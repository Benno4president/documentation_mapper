Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and HR Managers looking to set up leave. If you are unsure of what leave and absence employment terms are correct for your business or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.    What is a Leave balance? A leave balance is used to store the amount of leave an employee accrues and has made available for them to use. The balance decreases over time as employees use it for leave requests, and increases as they accrue more time off.  Note:  Once you  apply a Leave template to an employee , their account is created to hold their balance and handle their leave requests. By default, the Leave accounts page shows the account’s estimated balance as of today, allowing you to check the account’s balance on a past or future date by adjusting the end date of the period filter. For a detailed view over a longer period of time, set both a start and end date on the period filter.   Manual adjustments to leave balances If you, as an admin, need to change an employee’s balance for any reason, you can create a manual adjustment by: Going to  Schedule  &gt;  Leave accounts   Select the employee’s applicable leave account Click  Edit  in the section showing the current balance A manual adjustment can add or deduct from an employee’s leave balance and can be set to take effect from the current date or a date in future. Note:  Whilst you are able to make changes to leave balances, please note that overriding or changing these could be in breach of your compliance obligations. You should seek independent legal advice as appropriate for your business. Leave balance when using Planday with Xero Planday estimates your employees’ leave balances based on Schedule data, however, the balances are only estimates and you and your employees should always refer to the latest Xero payslip to learn the exact amount of leave available. Please note that leave balances displayed in Planday are only estimates and you and your employees are always advised to check Xero Payroll for exact leave account balances. We encourage you to perform regular reviews and audits of leave accruals and balances to ensure your business is meeting your obligations as an employer with respect to your employees’ entitlements. What is a Leave accrual? This is the estimated hours an employee becomes entitled to use, depending on the number of hours they work or the length of time they are an eligible employee.   In order for your employees to earn leave in Planday, we use  Start balances  and  Leave accrual rates  to calculate the amount of available leave.    By setting a  Start balance  on the employee’s Leave account, you can make the eligible amount of leave available to them from the beginning of their applicable entitlement period.    To accrue leave gradually, Planday uses a  Leave accrual rate . The rate is always specified in the  Leave templates  in Settings and is inherited by all employees’ accounts.    You can choose between various methods of accrual such as percentage, hours per day, or hours per month. If your employees are entitled to a fixed amount of leave, you can set a ‘Start balance’ and set the rate to ‘Do not accrue’.   Leave templates’ accrual rates will vary depending on the modern award you have enabled from Planday’s award library. Please note that Planday focuses on the most common types of leave and absence and does not cover all of the leave and absence types, for example, Long Service Leave, Community Service Leave and Parental Leave. Refer to this  Help Centre article  for more information about the leave and absence exclusions.     Next:  How to assign leave accounts to your employees   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins or Schedule managers with access to relevant departments in order to approve timesheets on Planday web. What are Timesheets? The Timesheets feature in Planday helps schedule managers and admins see important information about employees' working hours, breaks, overtime, and leave all in one place.   With the timesheet approval process, managers can compare an employee's scheduled hours with the actual hours they worked. They can also see if an employee was scheduled for paid or unpaid breaks, as well as any overtime. If a shift is in conflict with any predefined rules in your Planday setup, such as Working time rules or  Punch Clock deviations , the admin is prompted to make an informed decision to assign the appropriate Shift type or split the shift as needed before sending it to payroll. Note:  Timesheets will only handle split shifts if they haven't been approved in the Schedule or via the app. Where can you find Timesheets in Planday? You can access the timesheets approval page via the top menu in  Planday  &gt;  Timesheets  or from the  Pending actions widget  on the Home dashboard.   On this page, you can see all the pending shifts that are waiting for approval. You have the following options to customise what you see: Interval  – You can choose a specific period to review such as  day ,  week  (default), or  month . Departments  – You can view timesheets of employees from all departments (default) or select a specific department for approval. Employees  – You can view timesheets for a particular employee or gather data for all employees (default) in the selected department(s). Status  – You can filter shifts by status 🟠  Pending  (default), 🟢  Approved  or  All  shifts. If you approved shifts from the schedule, or approved leave requests, you can see them on the timesheet by changing the status to  Approved  or  All . When you click on a timesheet, you will see a detailed breakdown of the hours involved, including:  Basic shift information: This includes the date, time, location and status of the shift. Scheduled time: The planned duration of the shift as per the schedule. Punch time: The actual clock-in and clock-out times recorded from the Punch Clock. Suggested time: The difference between scheduled time and punch time which will be displayed as a split in the shift through a normal shift type and overtime shift type(s). Suggested times will vary depending on whether one or more of the following is set up: Punch Clock deviation rule Contract rule Working time rule How to approve a timesheet entry Note:  The timesheet status cannot be reverted to the pending state once approved. Therefore, it is crucial to review the shift data carefully before marking it as approved. It is, however, possible to unapprove an approved shift from the schedule. Go to Planday &gt;  Timesheets . If needed, you can refine your approval scope by selecting an  interval ,  department  or  employee  and set the status to  Pending  if not already selected. Click on any of the timesheet entries to view the shift details. Review  the shift information and make any modifications if required, such as adjusting punch time, or applying a specific overtime shift. Press  Approve  to review the next entry in your selected interval. Note:  If an employee worked in more than one department, and a manager approves their timesheet entry there, it will show up as previously approved for Admins. Also, approved leave requests will appear under preapproved timesheet entries. How to view or modify the Shift type, including split shifts To view or modify the Shift type: Click on the day displaying the shift you need to view or modify. To modify the shift type, click on the drop-down located under the heading ‘Shift type’. Select the new shift type.   Where split shifts are suggested such as in the case of Overtime: Click on the day displaying the shift(s) you expect to see split shifts suggested The shift(s) that have been split based on Contract rules and Working time rules will show the breakdowns between the ‘Normal’ and ‘Overtime’ shift types For the suggested ‘Overtime’ shift types, these can be updated to another shift type as needed* * Note : If you’ve enabled an award in Planday, you’ll need to ensure you select the appropriate Shift type as needed to ensure you meet your award compliance requirements. Refer to the Award for more information or alternatively contact the Fair Work Ombudsman to discuss in more detail.   How to edit the shift time To edit a shift’s scheduled time: Click on the day displaying the timesheet you need to edit a shift’s clocked-in time. Enter in the new time(s) in the start and/or end time fields.   How to manage breaks in timesheets To view, add or edit a break: Click on the day displaying the shift you need to view, add or edit a break. Under the section titled ‘Break’ action the following: View if the break is paid or unpaid, start and end times and duration of the break.

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For admins new to Planday with Payroll Admin access in Xero.  Instructions in this set-up guide are for Xero customers based in Australia only. See  Xero integration FAQ . Step 1: Setup Step 2: Finalise your Setup ◉ ◎ ⏱ 5 minutes ⏱ 10 minutes Connect your organisation 💡 If you have signed up for Planday through the Xero App Store or Xero TAS, your organisation will already be connected and activated. You can skip this section and proceed to  Sync employee data . If your Xero organisation wasn’t connected automatically when you signed up from Planday, you’ll need to connect it first.   Log in to Planday and head to  Settings  &gt;  Integrations  &gt;  Overview . Open the Xero integration by clicking  Connect .   Next, click  Add  under the  Organisations  section to connect to a Xero organisation.   You will be directed to a Xero login page, and once logged in, you will see an application authorisation prompt for Planday. Select the Xero organisation you want to connect with from a drop-down list and press  Allow access  to continue. ⚠️ If the pop-up doesn’t appear, check that your browser is not blocking pop-up windows. Your connected Xero organisation should be activated.   💡  Note that only one Xero organisation can be connected at a time. The current one must be removed if you want to connect to a different organisation.   Sync employee data You can import your employees from Xero now if you haven't already. By completing this step, you'll transfer existing employee data from Xero to Planday, so you won't have to set them up twice.   Click on the  edit icon  to the right on the line with your organisation's name.   If you have multiple departments in Planday, you’ll be asked to select one from the list because the employees must be linked to a department once they’re imported.    💡 You can change the department your employees are assigned to or assign them to multiple departments after finishing the integration set-up by navigating to  People &gt; Departments.  Read more about the  structure of Planday  and departments here.

Written by  Louise Devantier   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For admins new to Planday. Before going through this article, we suggest familiarising yourself with  Understanding the structure of Planday . Primary setup ◉ ⏱ 20-30 minutes  (depending on the number of employees) This article will guide you on how to enable an Award and apply the configurations to your employees, so you can keep track of rates of pay, worked hours, penalties and overtime. Note:  If Planday does not support the  Award  your business is covered by you can  set up your own employment terms . If you’re unsure of the correct Award coverage for your company or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the Fair Work Ombudsman to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business. Step 1: Enable an Award You can import an Award from the Planday Award library from the Dashboard.   Go to your Dashboard and under  Set up your Employment terms using Awards , click on the  Set up  button. Select the applicable Award and click on  Enable.  The built-in award interpretation will be configured to your Planday organisation shortly.   You can also enable an Award by navigating to  People  &gt;  Employment terms &amp; Awards  and click “Award library” in the top right corner and select which of the Awards you would like to enable.   To see what will be configured for each of the different awards, navigate to the  Australian awards  list.   Step 2: Set the appropriate Employee type on your employee Repeat this step for all of your employees. The next step is to apply the award configuration to your employees so it matches their employment terms. If you have not yet created your employees, you can navigate to this article to learn more about  creating employees  or navigate to this article to  import your employees from Xero .   Navigate to  People  &gt; Press the pencil to edit an employee &gt; switch to the  Employment  tab &gt;  Employee type  &gt; press  Edit  and choose the appropriate  Employee type .   Selecting the correct employee type is the foundation for overtime rates, penalties and Working time rules applying for this employee.   Step 3: Select Classification and set wage for your employee Repeat this step for all of your employees. Employees need to be linked to an  Employee group  before you can apply a Classification or to set the hourly wage for them. Once they are linked to an Employee group you can either choose a preset classification level or you can add an arbitrary hourly rate.    Navigate to  People  &gt;  Employees  &gt; Edit employee &gt; switch to  Employment  tab &gt;  Employee groups , to assign an employee group and set the hourly rate. Note penalty and overtime rates such as Casual Loading will be applied after and will be based on the wage input in the field below. Once you have chosen the appropriate classification or input a wage specific to the employee, press  Save .   When choosing a classification or setting a specific wage, it’s important to always check the Award and Fair Work’s  Pay and Conditions Tool (P.A.C.T)  if you’re unsure of the correct classification(s) or rate(s) to allocate to your business. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. Alternatively contact the Fair Work Ombudsman to discuss this in more detail.   Step 4: Add a Contract rule to your employee Repeat this step for all of your employees. Contract rules can be used to help you keep track of employees’ worked hours and overtime.   Navigate to  People  &gt;  Employees  &gt;  Edit employee  &gt;   switch to  Employment  tab   &gt;  Contract rules  to add a contract rule.    Next you need to set the start date and input the hours in the intervals as agreed upon between you and your employee. We recommend aligning start and valid from date with your pay cycle to ensure alignment in tracking of hours.   To learn more about Contract rules, please see the article:  Overview of Contract rules and Overtime .   To learn more about Contract rules, please see the article  Overview of Contract rules and Overtime . Step 5: Create a Public Holiday Calendar Repeat this step if your business operates across states with different Public holidays. Note:  Setting up a Public Holiday Calendar is essential, as it ensures that penalties for any leave taken around Public Holiday(s) are triggered correctly. To add a holiday calendar to Planday, navigate to  Settings  &gt;  General  &gt;  Public holiday calendar  &gt;  Add public holiday calendar.   The first calendar will be set as default and automatically assigned to all employees. You can edit the calendar later for each employee.   You can use the system calendars in Planday by selecting the appropriate calendar from the 'Create from existing' dropdown. You can later modify and add further dates if needed.   You can also leave the Create from existing field blank and build a calendar from scratch by adding the dates manually.   You need to put a start and end date for the calendar. We recommend the start date to align with when you started using Planday and the end date to be a few years out in the future as Planday will be updating the System calendars by adding more dates for future years and you’ll need to  extend your public holiday calendar .

          <attvalue for="2" value="Table of contents All Collections Get started Understanding the structure of Planday Understanding the structure of Planday Get to terms with the structure of Planday and align it to your Australian organisation. Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents This article illustrates the organisational structure in Planday and how to align it to your business. It will explain what the different levels of the organisational structure are and how you might best use them to set up your business within Planday.     Planday account/Business When you sign up for a free trial and put in the name of your business, a Planday organisation will be created for you with a unique URL usually resembling the business name. If you wish to change the URL, please contact our support team through the chat.   Your Planday serves as an umbrella where you can manage your entire business regardless of how many locations you might be operating in, which leads us to the next level.   Departments Departments are the next level in aligning Planday to your business. You can use departments to create separate schedules to differentiate between different locations or business areas/teams within a single location. You might have a shop in Melbourne and one in Sydney and you can create a department for each location. You could also have one restaurant in Melbourne but with enough employees for it to make sense to split the schedule in two; Café &amp; Kitchen. By having two separate departments you can assign a manager role to one of your staff members who then gets access to creating and editing the schedule in just one department.   At a Department level, you can customise: the Schedule Punch Clock Geolocations Time zones Manager permissions Break rules Reporting Revenue Absence accounts To learn more about departments, read our article on how to  Create and edit departments.   Employee groups Now that you have got your Planday set up with your Departments, we can move on to the third level, Employee groups.   These groups represent the job roles within your business. For example, managers and cashiers. You can create an employee group for each of these roles and then add your employees to whichever group they belong to.   Whenever you create a shift in the schedule and you choose which job role is to be carried out, you will only be able to choose employees who are in that employee group. This way, you make sure that your employees will only be able to cover shifts they’re qualified for or trained to undertake.   Each employee can be in multiple employee groups if they have the qualifications or skills to carry out multiple different roles within your business.   At an employee group level you can customize: Award classification Payroll supplements Break rules Working time rules Reporting Absence accounts Documents and folders   To learn more about employee groups, please read our article on how to  Create and edit Employee groups .   Employee types The Employee type has to be assigned to each individual employee, such as full-time, part-time or casual employment. The employee type in turn impacts what Award specific entitlements your employee has, when they apply and whether they are full-time, part-time or casual.   If you do not wish to make use of the existing penalty rates and working time rules, you can create your own employee type, which will not be connected to any of these features by navigating to  Settings  &gt;  People  &gt;  General  &gt;  Create . Before doing so, we recommend you contact the Fair Work Ombudsman or seek independent legal advice to discuss this in detail and consider any implications for your business.   Further to this, if you are unsure of the correct Award coverage for your company or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the Fair Work Ombudsman to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly.   On an employee-type level you can customize: Award classification Payroll supplements Break rules Working time rules Absence accounts   To learn more about employee types, please read our article on how to  Create and edit Employee types.

Written by  Frederik Bøgelund Christiansen   Updated over a week ago Table of contents Step 1 – Primary setup Step 2 – Secondary setup  ◉ ◎ ⏱ 20-30 minutes   ⏱ 25-35 minutes   This step first will cover the foundational set-up required for you to set up your own employment terms in Planday including breaks, Working time rules and penalty rates.  Step 2  will cover configuring contract rules, shift types and payroll supplements to track ordinary hours and overtime.    These steps are relevant if you haven’t enabled any of the supported awards from the Award library. We recommend that you create a Public holiday calendar relevant for your business or employees before proceeding. Navigate  here  to learn more.    Furthermore, it is advisable to ensure that departments and employee groups are set up accordingly to your business before initiating the set-up in this article.  See  Understanding the structure of Planday  to learn more.    If you’re unsure of what employment terms are relevant to your business or your employees, we encourage you to visit the  Fair Work Commission Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. You may also wish to seek independent legal advice as may be appropriate for your business. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly.    1. Employee types Employee types are used to define the employees’ type of employment i.e. full-time, part-time or casual. This sets the foundation for other rules such as breaks, penalties and absence.   Navigate to  Settings &gt; People &gt; General &gt; Employee types  to create the relevant employee types for your business.    Learn more about Employee types in an article  here .   2. Breaks Break rules can be set up to automatically apply different type of breaks to shifts based on i.e. shift length. You can set up different types of breaks that may be relevant to your employees, such as unpaid meal breaks and paid rest breaks.   Navigate to  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Breaks  to create the relevant break rules for your business. On the left-hand side of the create form, you can define  who this break should apply  for based on I.e. employee type. The parameter on the right-hand side is used to defining  when the rule should apply  to the chosen employees and if the break is  paid  or  unpaid .    Read more about break rules  here .    3. Working time rules Working time rules are used to set guidelines for how to schedule your employees. For example, you can create a rule on the maximum number of hours an employee can work. If a shift longer than the maximum is created, you will be prompted a warning in the schedule.   Navigate to  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Working time rules  to create working time rules relevant for your business.     4. Automating Penalty rates using Payroll supplements  Navigate to  Settings &gt; Payroll &gt; Payroll supplement  to set up penalty rates applicable for your employees.    These rates will apply automatically based on the parameters input when creating the payroll supplement. Learn more about the different types of supplements  here .    Below is an  example  of how to set up a  Sunday penalty rate  with a 2.0 multiplier that only applies to permanent staff.    Supplement type: Normal supplement  for penalties  If connected to Xero:   Create in Xero as    Ordinary time  for penalties  Title: This will be shown on the  Payslip   Start &amp; End: 12am – 12am  means that it applies to all 24 hours of the day. (For an evening penalty, you might choose 6pm – 12am)      Payroll:  In this example, we set a 100% increase, which  will add an additional 100% on top of the employee’s base rate.  Base rate = $20 + 100% supplement = $40  Days of the week: Sunday   Employee types: Employee types:  Part-time and Full-time    Remember, the multiplier rate might differ for Casuals, in which case you can create a separate supplement for them.

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For Admins.  Familiarise yourself with  Description of the leave account templates  article. If you are unsure of what leave and absence employment terms are correct for your business or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.   In this article, we will cover how to create  leave accounts  manually, how you can automate this process, where you can find an overview of the applied leave accounts and how to adjust balances to include previously accrued leave. Assign leave accounts to an employee or employee group automatically If you want to automate the process in which leave accounts are applied to your employees, go to  Settings &gt; Leave &amp; Overtime &gt; Account templates  &gt; Click on any of your leave templates to open up the settings &gt; toggle on Apply automatically.   The system will now create a leave account for all employees that meet the criteria defined in the account template.   It is important to make sure that the account templates are linked to the correct employee types before toggling on “Apply automatically” in the account template settings.   Apply leave accounts to an employee or employee group manually If you don't want to apply leave accounts automatically to your employees, you can apply them manually by going to  Schedule &gt; Leave accounts &gt; Apply template .   Choose if you want to Apply an account template to one employee or Apply the account template to multiple employees.   Apply a leave account to a single employee First, select the option below:   Step 1: Choose the account template you wish to apply to your employee Step 2: Set the date from which the employee can use the account Accrual period : date from which the employee starts accruing leave on the account .   Account period : the date from which the employee is eligible to use the account.   Accrual rate : amount of holiday accrued based on the applied template.   Start balance : quantity of leave available at the start of the account period. Adjust the balance to ensure the employee can access leave accrued prior to setting up the account.

Payroll - Salary code : salary code to be displayed in reports for the employee’s leave.   Advanced details - Notes : Add notes to the account that are only visible to the managers with full access to Planday.   Click  Save  if you’re happy with the settings.   You can always revisit these settings and adjust them after the leave account has been created. Note : Whilst you are able to make changes to the templates, please note that overriding or changing these configurations could be in breach of your compliance obligations. You should seek independent legal advice as appropriate for your business. Apply leave accounts to multiple employees Choose the option  Apply account template to multiple employees.    Step 1:  Choose the account template you wish to apply to your employees.   Step 2:  Select the departments, employee types and start date.   You can select one or several departments when applying account templates to multiple employees.   Departments : Define which employees to include based on what department they belong to. Employee types : Define which employees to include based on their employee type. Start date : Define the date from when the employee may start spending leave. The default date will be the one defined in the account template in settings. Accrual rate : amount of holiday accrued based on the applied template Start balance : quantity of leave available at the start of the account period. This value can also be adjusted for employees’ accounts individually after applying the template. Payroll - Salary code : salary code to be displayed in reports for the employee’s leave When you are happy with the settings, click on  Save . You can always revisit and adjust these settings after creating the leave accounts.   Overview of the leave accounts Once a leave account is applied to an employee, you can see it listed under the Leave accounts overview page. You can find the overview of applied leave accounts by going to  Schedule &gt; Leave accounts .   The period is by default set to show accounts valid in the current month to date.  You can filter by Department, Employee group, Employee type and/or Account names by clicking  Filters .    Use the search bar to search for a specific employee or select  Account status  to define if you want to see active, inactive, available or all leave accounts in your overview.   The page shows the accounts’ accrual rates inherited from their templates. You can also see start balance available at the start of the chosen period, balances accrued and used during the period and the balance available at the end of the period. Adjusting the period filter’s date range lets you inspect account usage across various time periods.   Adjusting account balance You might want to adjust a leave account balance to ensure your employee has access to leave they accrued prior to creation of the leave account. This can be done both when applying a template or later when the account is already created.   To sync up balances with your payroll system, identify the date of our last pay run and locate balances on employees’ pay slips. Then adjust the Accrual period start date to match the pay run date and adjust the Start balance of the employees’ accounts in   Schedule  &gt;  Leave accounts.   Alternatively, you can create a Manual adjustment and leave the Start balance at 0 if you prefer to make the change traceable or to add a comment. Please note that adjustments cannot be changed and the only way to alter changes is by creating another adjustment. Note:  It’s important to note that leave balances displayed in Planday are only estimates and you and your employees are always advised to check Xero Payroll for exact leave account balances. We encourage you to perform regular reviews and audits of leave accruals and balances to ensure your business is meeting your obligations as an employer with respect to your employees’ entitlements.

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For admins new to Planday with Payroll Admin access in Xero. Instructions in this set-up guide are for Xero customers based in Australia only. Complete  Step 1  of Xero integration or see  Xero integration FAQ here . Step 1: Setup Step 2: Finalise your Setup ◎ ◉ ⏱ 5 minutes ⏱ 10 minutes Sync payroll data This step will guide you through synchronising payroll data between Planday and Xero. This means that you’ll be able to create Earning rates and Overtime earnings in Xero based on your Employee groups and Payroll supplements in Planday. Ideally, you’ll have  enabled the relevant award  for your business and set up your Employee groups before completing this step, see  how to create or edit Employee groups article  if you haven’t done so already. Ensure that the checkmark ☑️ is selected for:  When pay items are created or updated in Planday, they should also be created and updated automatically in the connected Xero organisation . Uncheck this if you want to map using Salary codes instead. Click the  edit icon  to the right on the line with your organisation's name to configure sync of payroll data.   By clicking  Manual sync  your Employee groups and Payroll supplements will be synced to Xero and created as pay items. This synchronisation can take a while, especially if you have awards enabled. Once the sync is done, you’ll see an overview of the automatically mapped items.   The next step is to map employees to one of the Earning rates. This connection will update the ordinary earning rate on the employee’s pay template in Xero. 💡  It is recommended that you update the employees' ordinary earning rates at the start of the pay period. Click on the Earning rate that you want to map an employee to, select the adequate employees and click  Add . Repeat the process for the other earning rates until you have successfully mapped all the employees to an earning rate and then click  Next  in the top right corner.   Sync Leave types In this step, you will connect the  leave accounts  in the two systems.   Click  Add mapping  and select which of your leave types from Xero you would like to match to your Planday Absence accounts, then click  Add . In the overview, you will see a list of the selected leave types and you will now match them to Planday Absence accounts by selecting the applicable ones from the dropdown menu and then clicking  Save  in the top right corner.   💡  Please note that only hour-based Absence accounts can be synced with Xero and we currently support the following leave types: annual, personal &amp; carers, compassionate and unpaid leave.   Export timesheets to Xero To preview and export  approved timesheets  from Planday to Xero go to  Payroll  &gt;  Xero payroll . Here you specify the output by using the filters below and preview the hours that will be synced to Xero. Click  Preview report  to see an overview of which employees have hours in the chosen period and select individual employees to see their hours. Use the  Show details  button to see a detailed breakdown of the hours. Xero Organisation:  Name of the Xero organisation you are syncing. Pay run:  Select the appropriate pay run in the drop-down. You need to have a draft payrun in Xero before you can sync. Read more about  processing a pay run at Xero Central. Department:  Select the departments that you want to sync the hours from.  Shifts:  Select whether approved, non-approved or all shifts should be included in the report. Note that all shifts synced will be created as approved timesheets in Xero. Employee type:  Choose which employee types should be included in the report. Employee group:  Choose which employee groups should be included in the report. Note by clicking the tiny arrow on the right-hand side of Employee type and Employee group you can select and deselect the individual employees.   To sync the hours to Xero, click  Sync report  in the top right corner. Once the sync is complete, head over to Xero to process your pay run.

          <attvalue for="2" value="Table of contents All Collections Set up Xero Integration Xero integration FAQs Xero integration FAQs Frequently asked questions regarding Xero setup, employee syncing, time &amp; pay run syncing and supported functionalities. Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated yesterday Table of contents 🎯  This article is for admins with an existing Xero integration with Planday. Set up Xero Payroll  if you have not done so already. Integration setup questions My organisation is not connected successfully. If you have the following message: &quot;Payroll not initialised&quot; status, it means that the Payroll module of your organisation is not set up yet. To fix this, open  Xero.com , navigate to your Xero organisation and click  Payroll → Overview . Visiting this page will initialise the Payroll module and the next time you open the Xero integration in Planday, the status should be updated. If you have the following message: “You do not have sufficient payroll permissions”, you need to ensure that the user who connected the organisation has payroll permissions in Xero and has not been deactivated.   Employees syncing questions How might STP2 transition affect my employee data? Whilst going through Xero's employee STP2 wizard, some of the data in your employee's profile may get erased, such as the ordinary hours earning rate. If this has happened, you can: either resync this information from  Planday's Xero integration editor or simply navigate to the employee's profile in Xero and introduce the details again. What information is required to add an employee in Planday and Xero? In Planday, we only need  first name ,  last name , and  email  to add employees to the system.   Ensure that the fields listed below are filled in the employee profile if you wish to sync employee details to Xero.   Gender Address Post Code* City Date of birth State Country * If you have an Australian Xero organisation, please ensure your postcode is at least four numbers long. It must also be between 0200-9999 for the employee to be synced and created between systems. What employee data is synced? The employee data that will be synced is gathered from the following fields:    First and Last name Email address Address Birthday State Country Remember to always create and update employees in Planday, as this is a one-way sync. What if my employees belong to different groups and have different wages? So long as your Xero integration is Active and you've set up  Payroll data synchronisation , we will automatically map your employee groups and the wages as earning rates to Xero. When you add your employees to the Employee group in Planday and assign them a wage, we will then create an earnings line with the wage in the employee’s pay template in Xero.  Note:   Please, remember the employee must already have an earning line with their Ordinary Hours Earning rate for us to be able to do this in the case that you add them to a second employee group I have done the initial sync and have some leavers/deactivated employees still showing up, how can I prevent them from synching? The first time you sync your employees, you will see deactivated users. We will not need to sync these users so you can untick them before the sync. What happens with my leavers/deactivated employees? Planday will still push all of the worked hours in that date range into Xero so you do not need to worry about the hours, however, you will need to mark the employee as a leaver in Xero and process the last pay run-through here. Xero will also hold all of the information in regard to paying out or recovering any leave entitlements. I received an Allowance type error while running manual sync. You would need to navigate to your  Xero organisation  &gt;  Payroll  &gt;  Pay items  &gt; Find an Allowance which is missing a value in the Allowance Type dropdown and set a value. Then try and run  Manual Sync  again in Planday.   Leave management questions How will leave be managed between Planday and Xero? While you can record your leave in Planday, we will not be sending leave-related payroll data over to Xero. Planday sends the date range and the hours of leave. Therefore, any payments will be managed within Xero. In Planday, you will be using  Leave templates . Planday will handle: The request and schedule of leave Leave accruals Estimates of leave balances (based on approved shifts) Whereas Xero will handle the payment and balance of holidays, and continue to be the final source for leave balances. Once you approve a leave request in Planday, it will be included in the payroll transfer to Xero for that pay period. It will be registered in Xero as a leave request, but once you hit  Post Pay Run  in Xero, the request is also approved in Xero. For any questions on how to add absence in Xero, please contact the Xero support team or your account manager at Xero. Note:  It’s important to note that leave balances displayed in Planday are only estimates and you and your employees are always advised to check Xero Payroll for exact leave account balances. We encourage you to perform regular reviews and audits of leave accruals and balances to ensure your business is meeting your obligations as an employer with respect to your employees’ entitlements.   Time &amp; Pay run syncing questions Note:   See what gets transferred to Xero in this  payroll report overview article .   Are all the hours synced with Xero (including sickness and time off)? In Planday, you have the option to exclude selected shifts from payroll sync. To exclude shifts: Create a shift type under  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Shift types  with a salary code &quot;non-applicable&quot;, &quot;NA&quot; or leave it blank. Then assign the shift type to the desired shifts. Such shifts will not be synced to Xero. If you want to overwrite any automatic wage mapping you have created during the setup of the integration, you can assign a salary code to the shifts if you navigate to  Settings &gt; Payroll &gt; General,  scroll down to  Salary Codes  and enter the code for hourly workers in the  Hours worked (as per shifts)  field.  You’ll then be able to link those salary codes to already existing pay items in Xero. Are the pay rate and bank details updated in Xero? We currently don't sync bank account details, but we do sync the employees' hourly rates from the employee group they are members of.   As of now, if an hourly wage in Planday is to be applied from a specific date to run payroll, you need to update this wage only after you post the last pay run. Suppose, the last pay run ends on 28-02 of the current year and you want to set to new rate for 01-03. You’ll need to: first, run the last pay run where the old rate applies then update the hourly wage in Planday and set the valid from date to the start date of the next pay run    Why are the minutes count different in Xero from the Planday payroll preview? Time can be expressed as fractions, decimals or as minutes and hours. To calculate payroll, time needs to be in decimal form so that it can be multiplied by an employee’s pay rate. Xero is an accounting software and will therefore report in decimal minutes. I can’t see the correct date range in the Planday pay run You need to ensure that you have created a draft pay run setup in Xero before you can see the information in the Planday dropdown. Create a draft pay run by going to  Xero  &gt;  Payroll  &gt;  Pay employees.  Click  Add Pay Run  &gt;   Select a pay period &gt; press  Next.  Read   more  about this at Xero Central . I got an error code stating my employees need calendar IDs set up This means that you have no employment record in the Xero setup against the Employee. This could potentially be a new starter or someone who needs to be added to Xero. Follow the instructions from Xero Central on an  Employee is missing from a pay run . I got an error mentioning TrackingItemID when I tried to sync my hours You got the following error message when trying to sync your hours to Xero:  TrackingItemID is required for each timesheet line.   This is because you have enabled Tracking Categories in your Xero organisation, however, this is currently not supported in Planday, so you'll need to disable this option in Xero to continue with the Payroll synchronization.   To do this, log into your  Xero account , go to  Settings  &gt;  Payroll settings  and in the  Payroll Tracking  section &gt;  Timesheet Categories  &gt; Select  None  in the dropdown. Can I redo the hours exported to Xero for some employees? Yes, you can export the hours again, but you would need to do the following in Xero: Go to Pay employees &gt; Pay run &gt; Reset ( Guidance on Xero Central ) Then go to Timesheets &gt; Revert to draft &gt; Delete ( Guidance on Xero Central )   Supported functionalities &amp; limitations questions Does the integration support tips or service charges? Service charges and tips are usually handled outside of Planday and directly through Xero. However, if you wish to manually enter tips into Planday you can do so by using a manual payroll supplement. You will then need to manually match the payroll supplement's salary code with the equivalent pay item in Xero.    In some cases, this can be time-consuming and it may be quicker to manage supplements directly into Xero. Does the integration support my salaried staff? At the moment, the integration supports hourly workers only. Salaried staff in Xero will be paid out the same each pay period so there is no need to send the hours over to Xero. We will still keep the historical shift data on salaried employees in Planday but not push it through to Xero. What are the supported earning categories and rate types? Xero only allows the following earnings categories and rates for timesheets to be imported through the integration: Earnings Categories Ordinary Time Earnings Overtime Earnings Rate types Rate per unit (Unit must be set to Hours) Multiplier - Only for Ordinary Hours Earning rate of employee How do I read shift types in the Xero payroll preview? Unless you have shift types in Planday that are mapped using salary codes, any hours or units attached to  unmapped  shift types in the Xero payroll preview will not be synced to Xero via the integration.

Set up Xero Payroll  if you have not done so already.   Before synchronising your Planday payroll data with Xero, please consider reviewing the following points to ensure that the correct information is sent for your employees to be paid accurately.   Create a report preview To create a report preview, navigate to the Xero payroll overview page by going to  Payroll &gt;   Xero Payroll.   What is included in the report? Please enter all the necessary parameters at the top of the screen, and press the  Preview report  button.    💡 Remember, if you can’t select your desired Pay Run, make sure to create a Draft Pay Run in Xero first.   You will see a list of all the employees that match the criteria, set by filtering for Departments, shift status, Employee types and Employee groups.   The list will show employees by their first name and last name.   Check that you are looking at the correct Pay period and that all your employees are included in the preview.    View a summary of an employee's details You can click on one of the employees to get complete detail of their worked hours.   Total Shifts Here you can see an overview of how many shifts ( Total shifts ) this particular employee has worked and the breakdown of worked hours.   Type of shifts Under  Shift type , you will be able to see what kind of shifts this employee has worked, for instance, regular hours, paid leave or sick leave, and how many units (hours) each were scheduled for.   Payroll supplements Under  Payroll supplement , you can see a different overview of all the overtime and penalty rates that automatically apply to an employee’s shifts. View a detailed breakdown of all units Click on  Show details  to get an even more detailed overview of the above subcategories.   Here you can see the specific date, time of day, position or job role, and the number of hours worked on any given shift.   Handing of penalties On shifts where  penalties  are applied, for example, on Sundays or Public holidays, the overview will show ‘0’ hours under  Quantity  for that particular shift and instead allocate all of the hours to the penalty. This method of allocating the hours gives a more transparent overview while also matching the setup of the payroll reporting functionality in Xero.   Handling of breaks Both  Unpaid  and  Paid breaks  are included in this detailed overview. However, Paid breaks are included as part of the Regular hours units, while unpaid breaks are excluded from the calculations. While both Unpaid and Paid breaks show as ‘0.5’, the Unpaid break will not be sent to Xero, but the Paid break will be included in the total units of Regular hours or overtime/penalty rates if Paid breaks are applied during this period.    Handling of Leave types Leave type is where the leave requests made by employees and approved by admins will be shown. Any leave that requires an account will show as an instance of leave both as a Shift type and a Leave type. Planday will handle the request and schedule of leave, whereas Xero will take care of the payment and balance of leave.  💡Note that the Xero integration only supports leave requests counted in hours, not days.   💡  Please note:  This overview is explicitly made for Xero users. In Planday, we can create a more generic payroll report under  Payroll  &gt;  Payroll export . However, the generic and Xero payroll reports should not be used to compare each other as the breakdown of hours into subcategories differs between the two reports. The total amount of hours will be identical, but the breakdown is different, so it is not recommended to compare the two in terms of the breakdown of the hours.   Need more help?

Looking for  set-up instructions ? Notes about Revenue Import Details Integration timing The integration imports revenue data from Square once a day. The import takes place within one hour starting at the hour selected in the  Start import at  field.  Typically, the import runs near the beginning of the specified interval.    Tax Always Included Integration always imports Gross value from mapped locations. There is no option to import Net value or get information about Tax level or Tax value separately.  Revenue Value The imported revenue is the sum of revenue values of all active Locations mapped to the Revenue unit from successfully connected Merchant accounts. If any merchant connection does not work, revenue from the merchant’s locations will not count in the revenue imported into the mapped Revenue units. ⚠️ Note that incomplete revenue values will overwrite correct values imported in the past if a Merchant account connection stops working and if you are importing values for several days in the past.   FAQs Merchant account needs to be reconnected. In some instances, authorization to the connected account can fail, and the account will need to be reconnected. The user will be informed of that state in the Merchants card where such status will be displayed next to the corresponding account. How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, the user must remove all connected merchants. This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be deleted and stays in Planday. How can I verify imported values? Verify in Planday:  Open the  Schedule  page on Planday. Press the  View settings  button,  turn on the Revenue toggle  to reveal revenue values at the bottom of each Schedule day.   Revenue imported for a given Revenue unit is displayed in the  Daily revenue  pop-up. 💡 Note that the Notes field contains the timestamp of the revenue import and a label of the revenue source. The shown timestamp reflects the  UCT time zone , and it is not adjusted for your Planday organisation’s location! Verify in Square:  Open your  Square Seller dashboard   https://squareup.com/dashboard  and log in using the same merchant account you used to connect with Planday. Navigate to  Reporting , then  Transactions .   Set relevant values in the filter: The date should reflect the period you are checking. Set types to  Payments . Set the status to  Complete . Select the location you want to verify. The value you should compare with imported revenue in Planday is shown in the  Total collected  field.  Square sign-in window is not showing Ensure your browser is not blocking pop-up windows, as those can often be blocked as default browser setting. Revenue not importing Make sure that there is at least one Shift in the Schedule on each day where revenue should be imported. Ensure that the  Enter daily revenue  checkbox, located in  Settings  &gt;  Revenue , is selected for mapped Revenue units. Verify that Square locations are mapped to Revenue units of relevant Departments in Planday. Merchant account needs to be reconnected If a merchant account needs to be reconnected, a corresponding status will be displayed on the Merchants card. To reconnect the account, you must click on the account’s table row in the Merchants card. A pop-up window asking you to sign in again will appear. You must log in to the correct Square account. Once you sign in, the connection status will be updated in the table.   When an account needs to be reconnected, its revenue will not be imported into Planday, meaning that you might notice unusually low revenue shown on the Schedule. To remedy this, after reconnecting the account, you can increase the number of imported days to overwrite days showing partial revenue figures. Revenue imported to Planday does not match the value reported by Square Check Payments Status  The integration calculates revenue based only on payments marked as  Complete . Since payments can take up to a few days to be processed, it is possible that imported revenue will not correspond to values shown in Square, or that the value shown in Schedule will change during the next import. If you wish to compare values more accurately, filter transactions in Square by the  Completed  status.   Check Connection Status  Please check that all connections are in  Connected  status. If a connection doesn’t work correctly, then Payments related to Locations from this connection will not be imported. Need more help?

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 This integration is for Planday admins based in Australia, the UK and the USA only. Looking for  Square troubleshooting or FAQ ? Before setting up the integration, you need to   create revenue units   in the departments you want to import revenue.   You should also be aware that revenue can only be imported on days when at least one shift in the Schedule exists.   The integration imports Gross value. It is not possible to import Net value or get information about Tax level or Tax value separately.   Connect your integration The first thing you need to do is  Connect  your integration. Head to  Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Overview . Click  Connect  on the Square tile to open the integration.   Connect your Square merchants by clicking the  Connect merchant  button, which will prompt a Square log-in screen in a pop-up window.   ⚠️ If the pop-up doesn’t appear, check that your browser is not blocking pop-up windows.

FAQs and troubleshooting How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, you can remove individual connected Lightspeed accounts. This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be overwritten. 💡  Alternatively, click the  Options  drop-down on the Lightspeed Retail X-Series tile on the Integrations Overview page, then click  Revoke authorisation . This will revoke the integration’s access to Planday and stop all scheduled import jobs. How can I verify imported values? To verify in Planday:  Open the  Schedule  page on Planday. Press the  View settings  button, and  turn on  the  Revenue  toggle to reveal earnings values at the bottom of each business day.   Revenue imported for a given Revenue unit is displayed in the  Daily revenue  pop-up. 💡 Note that the Notes field contains the timestamp of the revenue import and a label of the revenue source. The shown timestamp reflects the  UCT time zone  and is not adjusted for your Planday organisation’s location! To Verify in Lightspeed:  The data in X-Series can be checked under your Lightspeed dashboard. Browse   your store account in Lightspeed and navigate  Menu  &gt;  Sales  &gt;  Sales History . Nothing happens when I click Connect account Ensure your browser is not blocking pop-up windows, which can often lead to the log-in window not appearing. Revenue not importing Ensure that there is at least one Shift on the Schedule for each day where revenue should be imported. Ensure that the  Enter daily revenue  checkbox, located in  Settings  &gt;  Revenue , is selected for mapped revenue units. Verify that Lightspeed Retail X-Series registers are mapped to Revenue units of relevant Departments. The account needs to be reconnected In some instances, authorisation to the connected account can fail, and the account will need to be reconnected. You can see the current status of the connected accounts displayed next to the corresponding account when you open the integration tile. To reconnect the account, you must click on the account’s table row in the Accounts section. A pop-up window asking you to sign in again will appear. You must log in to the correct X-series account. Once you sign in, the connection status will be updated in the table. ⚠️ When an account needs to be reconnected, its revenue will not be imported into Planday, meaning that you might notice unusually low revenue shown in the Schedule. To remedy this, after reconnecting the account, you can increase the number of imported days to overwrite days showing partial revenue figures. Revenue imported to Planday does not match the value reported by Lightspeed Retail POS A. Lightspeed Retail POS – Rounding issue Sometimes, the sale total will have some rounding calculation (more or less ~GBP0.01) due to tax calculations not falling on an exact penny value. When these fractional pennies accumulate over many sales, the differences can be seen more evidently.  This issue occurs only when tax is included in the import.   B. Check Payments Status  The integration calculates revenue based on sales marked as: Completed On Account Delivery, completed Layby, completed On account, completed Pickup, completed Pickup, unfulfilled Delivery, unfulfilled Since payments can take up to a few days to be processed, it is possible that imported revenue will not correspond to values shown in X-Series or that the value shown in the Schedule will change on the next import.    C. Check Connection Status  Please check once all connections are in  Connected  status. If some connection doesn’t work properly, sales related to Registers from this connection will not be imported.   Need more help?

          <attvalue for="2" value="Table of contents All Collections Scheduling Scheduling tools Schedule based on Availability preferences Schedule based on Availability preferences Make scheduling easy by using Availability to track when your employees want to work and when they can't. Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For managers who wish to register employee preferences for work. Are you contractually obliged with work timings? Use  Contract rules   instead . What is Availability? Availability allows you, the schedule manager, to record employees' wishes for work. Giving your employees shifts according to their wishes keeps them happy and can reduce the number of shift swaps and no-shows. Reduce managerial stress related to building a schedule and make a plan that will work for your business and your employees.   This is how Availability works: Employees register their  Availability from the Planday app  or desktop. Employees' Availability is shown on the Schedule when looking to assign shifts:  green  for available,  red  for unavailable. Managers use the information to build schedules that accommodate the employees in the best way possible. As a manager, you can still schedule employees on unavailable marked days, but having availability data filled out provides practical knowledge by cutting down on back-and-forth communication.   Using Availability preferences when scheduling When you create a shift and employees have registered their Availability, you'll see their status when you're working on the schedule.   As a manager, you decide to adjust the Schedule to your employees' Availability, and sometimes you might find yourself in situations where it isn't possible to accommodate their wishes.   Available employees show with a green thumbs-up next to their names. Employees who have set themselves as Unavailable will be marked with a red thumbs down.   If the employees have added a comment or reason with their wish, that will also show up when scheduling.   Customising options and intervals for Availability You can customise the availability function if it does not capture the necessary information for your needs.    Start by going to  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Swap &amp; Availability &gt; Availability.  Here you can set Availability by: Can/cannot work  (default) Intervals -  You can set up custom intervals employees can choose from, for example, Night shifts, Day shifts etc. Select start and end time -  This option will let your employees select a start and end time for when they're available or unavailable for each day. Set custom Availability settings In this example, the employer wants to capture further information from the employees, such as their availability to work night shifts. This can be configured by selecting  Intervals  under Available options from the Swap and Availability settings page.   Employees will then be prompted to select from these options when they mark their availability:   How can employees register their Availability wishes Employees can mark their availability via the Planday app or by logging in from the web.    To set Availability via the Planday app , employees can navigate to  More  &gt;  Availability  &gt; press  Edit  &gt; select the days you wish to mark &gt; Mark your availability by pressing  Available  or  Unavailable  &gt; press  Done .   To set your Availability via Planday for desktop , navigate to  Home  &gt;  Your   Availability  &gt; press  Edit all  &gt; select the days you wish to mark &gt; Mark your availability by selecting  Can work  or  Cannot work.

A normal Shift is displayed with the employee's name and time; by clicking on the Shift, you can view more information or  edit the Shift . Shifts can also have different colours to provide a quick status. The screenshot below shows six common examples of Shifts you may encounter on your Planday Schedule.    🔴 (1. Monday) - Open shift:  If you have a Shift that you need to be covered, but don’t know who can cover it, then create it as an  Open shift  for employees to request. Open shifts are easy to recognize by their red colour in the Schedule. 🔴 (2. Tuesday) Open shift (requested):  When one or more employees apply to take an Open shift, you can immediately see it in the Schedule with the text  Shift request . Assign the Shift and inform the employee to make sure you have all shifts covered. 🟢 (3. Wednesday) Approved shifts:  When a Shift is marked as ready for payroll, it turns green in the schedule. This makes it easy to see which shifts have been approved and which are still awaiting a manager's approval.  🖍 (4. Thursday) Shifts with a Shift type:  Use  Shift types  to record illness, training or another special event that distinguishes a Shift from a normal Shift. Shift types are created with a colour code and can be viewed directly in the Schedule. Administrators can always create and edit existing Shift types. ⏱ (5. Friday) Shifts with Punch in time:  If you are using the  Punch Clock , you can see the exact times when employees have clocked in and out of their shifts on the Schedule. In this example, an employee clocked in at 7:08 and clocked out at 15:05.  🟡 (6. Saturday) Shift for sale:  If an employee can't work their assigned shift, they can offer it to their colleagues with the right skill set to cover it. A shift offered for sale will appear on the manager’s schedule as yellow, providing an opportunity to help out.    🌴  (7. Tuesday) Leave shift :  Approved leave requests  show as approved shifts with a palm tree indicator in the top right corner. The shifts cannot be edited from the Schedule as they always reflect the leave request through which they were created. Daily Overview and Shift count Press the Shift count at the top of the schedule to see an overview of shifts and availability for the day. You can choose to only see specific types of shifts by pressing the settings ⚙️ icon. This also allows you to send messages to specific sets of people; for example, you might want to message only employees working on a day.   Payroll costs and Revenue At the foot of the schedule, you can input your Revenue for the day and compare it to your outgoing Payroll costs. If you have set a goal percentage for payroll costs against revenue, you can see a visual indicator here to keep you up to date. 💡 Enable this by going to  View Settings  and turning on  Revenue  or  Payroll hours &amp; costs  under the Finance settings.   Contract rules, Employee management, and Sorting If you use the Employees view of the Schedule, you can see the following functions and shortcuts. 1. See when you have deviated from an employee's contract  If you have set up  Contract rules  for your employees, you can see a visual indicator around their profile picture to see if they match their contracted hours.

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and Schedule managers. In this article, you will learn how to make the most out of Planday’s scheduling feature and spend the least amount of time to get the best possible overview of your employees’ scheduled hours.   To create a roster, you need three components: a Department, an Employee group and Employees. If you haven’t already set those components up, you can learn about them in the  Setup Planday article .   Create/copy a shift Navigate to the Schedule tab in the top bar. Now you can find the employee you wish to create and allocate a shift to and click the “+” icon on the chosen day.   From here you can set the start and end times of the shift and assign the correct Employee group/Job role for this particular shift.   Breaks can be applied manually to individual shifts or you can navigate to  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Breaks  to set up your own automatic  break rules .   Once you hit “ Create ” you will have created your very first shift in Planday. 💡 You can copy existing shifts by holding down ALT (Windows) or OPTION (Mac) while dragging and dropping your shift to another day or another employee.   Using Shift types Shift types are used to distinguish one type of shift from another, such as distinguishing paid leave from a standard working day.   You can also create your own custom-made Shift types by following the steps in the article  Create and use Shift types .   When you create or edit a shift in the schedule you can apply a Shift type. Once selected, hit “ Save ” and the shift has now been updated to reflect the chosen Shift type.     You are able to export reports from Planday that tell you how often employees have taken certain Shift types such as Personal/Carer’s Leave. Learn more about  using Shift type to generate reports . Scheduling with Contract rules Contract rules allow you to easily track how many hours your employees are contracted to work and compare this to how many hours they have been scheduled for.   A traffic light system is used to keep track of your employees' ordinary hours of work in relation to their contracted or agreed number of hours per week.   No outline: No Contract rule has been assigned to the employee. 🟡 Yellow outline = The employee has been scheduled to work too few hours, and there is no overtime. 🟢 Green outline = Employee has been scheduled to work the correct number of ordinary hours and has no overtime. 🔴 Red outline = The employee has been scheduled overtime hours. Learn how to  utilise Contract rules to manage Overtime .   Note:  If you haven’t set your employees up with Contract rules, please read the following article that is relevant to you: If you have enabled an award via our built-in Award library, click on  How to set up your employees with supported Awards - Add a Contract rule . If you haven't enabled an award via our built-in Award library, click on  How to set up your own employment terms - Apply Contract rules to employees .   Working time rules Working time rules have been set up to notify you when a shift has been scheduled that may be in conflict with a particular section of the relevant Award. For example, you will receive a warning should you schedule a shift for a casual employee for less than the minimum number of hours per shift detailed in the Award.   The Working Time Rules specific to the Modern Award covering your employees can be found by navigating to  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Working time rules .   If you were to accidentally create a shift that conflicts with one of the Working time rules set up within Planday, you will see a warning prompting you to do one of three things:   Ignore  - Keeps the shift as you created it. In this instance, we recommend you contact the Fair Work Ombudsman or seek independent legal advice to discuss the possible implications of keeping the shift unchanged.   Cancel  - The shift is not created.   Edit shift  - You are redirected back to the shift creation pop-up window allowing you to make any necessary changes.   Now that you have mastered how to schedule your employees based on the Award, you can save time when creating future schedules by using Templates.

Colour  - A colour code can make it easier to recognise the shift type in the Schedule, and when pulling shift type statistics.   Rate adjustment -  To give the employee their full wage, leave the rate at 100%. For no pay, set it to 0% (e.g. for Unpaid Sick Leave), and for overtime, or other hours with an extra allowance, set a value greater than 100%. There are also two additional options; replace the existing rate with a new amount per hour, and add an extra amount per hour to the existing rate. Please note, that depending on the setup in your payroll system, you might want to set up Payroll supplements in order to match your salary codes correctly.   Description  - Leave a description if you have multiple managers working with Shift types. The description only appears when editing a Shift type from Settings.   Settings  Allow conflicting shifts  - If you leave this unchecked, you'll receive a warning in the Schedule if you try to schedule the same employee for two shifts at the same time. If you have circumstances that will register an employee for multiple shifts at the same time, enable this option.   Allow booking  - Checking this box will allow for the Shift type to be booked when set to open, sold, or swapped. This will typically remain disabled for Shift types used to register sick leave, training, or staff meetings.   Overwrite when applying a template  - A Shift type with this option enabled will be overwritten when you apply a Schedule template in the Schedule. Uncheck the option for Shift types used to plan future events like staff meetings.   Include in Schedule print  - If you print or download your schedule, check this box to include the Shift type when doing so.   Include in Schedule message  - When sending messages to employees on the Schedule for a specific day, the Shift type will be included. This option will typically be disabled for Shift types used to register sick leave.   Count hours in payroll report  - Disable for Shift types that don't need to be included in any reports. For most Shift types this option is enabled.   Payroll supplements  - Check this box if you want hours from this Shift type to be affected by  Payroll supplements .   Break  - Check this box if you want breaks to apply for this Shift type. Read more about  setting up and working with breaks.   Meal contribution  - Check this box if you want meal contribution and deduction to apply for this Shift type. Meal contributions and deductions can be set up by going to  Settings  &gt;  Payroll  &gt;  Meal contribution and deduction .   Affects fixed salaried : Enable this option if this Shift type should apply to fixed salaried employees.   Confirm by clicking  Save . If you don't get all the settings right from the start, you can always go back and change them later.   ⚠️ Please note: When creating a new Shift type, check whether it should be linked to an existing  Contract rule . This will ensure the completeness of the contract term as all relevant Shift types will be included. Learn more in the article on  creating and applying Contract rules .

Apply templates and finish your schedule in minutes! Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and Schedule managers.  Get to know the  basics of Scheduling here .   What is a Schedule template? Schedule templates are great for creating your schedule's foundation or saving recurring days and weeks for later use. Templates can be applied to multiple periods simultaneously, saving precious time and making schedule creation a breeze.  Using Schedule templates, you can create a consistent schedule for multiple or single employees, apply  Shift types  to specific days or ranges, and exclude  Positions  when they shouldn't be filled. You also have the option to create Open shifts in the template and let your employees apply for them just like you would on your normal schedule.   Schedule templates overview You can find the  Templates  menu in the top right corner of the  Schedule  page. From here, you can do the following: Create  a new Schedule template. Save  your current schedule as a template. Edit  existing Schedule templates. Apply  an existing Template to the Schedule. Copy week  lets you duplicate the current week’s schedule to a future week. How to create a Schedule template When creating a new Schedule template, you have two options. You can: Create a new template  giving you an empty schedule to work with. Week template  - This lets you create a week’s worth of schedule that you can replicate for more weeks. Day template  - This lets you create a day’s schedule that you can apply for specific days, for example, a day template for busy occasions such as New Years' eve or a ready-to-go busy day's schedule that might occasionally occur. Save an existing schedule  as a template for editing and re-use. Create your Schedule template as you would create a schedule. You can duplicate the template week into more weeks and plan for fortnightly or months’ worth of schedules. Press  Save  when done.     Move and copy Shifts in the template editor If you have the same Shift on multiple days, you can copy it by holding down the  Alt/Option⌥ (Mac)  or  Alt (Windows) key and place it wherever you need. Note:  Copying shifts works across all three views in the templates editor: Employees, Groups, and Positions. To move a Shift, simply drag and drop it to where you want it.   Duplicate and reorder weeks in the template editor You can duplicate a completed week in the template editor by pressing the Plus (➕) icon or delete it by pressing (✖️). It is also possible to reorder the weeks by moving them in the editor window.     Apply a template to your Schedule When applying a Schedule template, it's essential to check the settings and the date you apply the template from and decide what to do about existing shifts on the schedule, if any.  First, navigate to the day or week in the Schedule where you want to apply the Template. Then press  Templates  &gt;  Apply template  from the menu. Select from the existing templates that you have created.   Settings to consider when applying a Template When applying a Schedule template, you have three options to choose from: Update existing, and add new shifts  - This option will try to merge the existing Schedule with the information from the Template: if a user already has a shift in the schedule on the same day as a shift in the template, it will be replaced by the template shift. Note:   Existing open shifts are replaced only in case they have exactly the same time and the same employee group as the shift from the template. Otherwise, a new shift will be created. Delete all and add new shifts  - This option will delete everything currently in the Schedule, and then add the information from the template. Keep existing shifts and add new shifts  - This option simply adds the template shifts onto the schedule without making any changes to the existing shifts. This means nothing is lost, but also means that the new shifts might conflict with pre-existing shifts. When switching between the options, you should see a preview of how the end result will look. We recommend applying templates to empty days or weeks. This gives you the best overview and control. Apply number of times  - Choose the number of times that the template should be applied. For example, if you are using a day-based template you can apply it up to 14 times to populate a fortnight in the schedule.  ⚠️ If you are using a larger template that covers several weeks, we recommend that you limit the number of times you apply a template. For example, if your template has 2 weeks of schedule and you apply it 4 times, you will generate schedule for the next 8 weeks. Use the  Employee  drop-down menu to limit the employee(s) that the template should apply to. By default, all employees are selected. By selecting individual  Shift types  you can tailor which shift types will be applied to the schedule. For example, on Monday you might have a shift type for a weekly meeting, which you can then deselect when applying the day to the rest of the week. As with employees and shift types, you can choose to include or exclude certain  positions  when applying your template. This may be useful if some of your positions are only expected to be filled during busy periods. When you've checked the settings, select  Next . Planday will check for any working time violations before you confirm by clicking  Apply .   Note that any manual breaks included on the Shifts will be preserved and copied over when you copy a week or create and use a Schedule template. Note:  If you have made a mistake and want to start over, you can always press  Tools  &gt;  Delete this week  to remove any created schedules. You also have the option to  hide certain days or periods  from the schedule.   Duplicate Schedule to a future week If you have a weekly schedule you want to reuse, you can quickly copy it by going to the  Templates  menu and selecting  Copy week . Choose the week you want to copy your schedule to and confirm. When you copy a week, all existing shifts that aren't already approved for payroll, or don't have Punch Clock entries, will be overwritten.   Note:  The best way to use  Copy week  is to always copy to an empty week. This way, you don't risk overwriting anything by accident. Schedule templates and Working time rules When you apply a Schedule template to a week, a check against Working time rules is run. This is useful for ensuring you don't schedule employees in breach of working time regulations in your company or industry.  Checks against Working time rules are also made for every change you make to the schedule, such as moving or copying shifts, adding employees to open shifts, or modifying the shift length. Check out this article for more information on how to set up Working time rules.   Need more help?   Please search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our ▶️  video tutorials .

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For admins and schedule managers.  Are you an employee? See how to indicate  your availability wishes . What is Contracted availability? The  Contracted availability  feature allows you, as an admin or schedule manager, to mark specific days or time intervals in which you have agreed with your employee to work. Typically, this is based on an employment contract or terms you have in place with agreed hours and days. For example, you can hire staff for weekends or morning shifts only and mark their contracted availability so you can be alerted if you schedule them outside these periods.  💡 This feature differs from  availability  settings, where employees indicate their wishes or availability for work without having a contractual obligation or an agreement.  This feature can help you get an overview of specific scheduling guidelines or contractual agreements that may influence the schedule and make it easier for you to see who is available and when.  How to set an employee’s Contracted availability You can add or edit an employee's  Contracted availability  from the quick edit menu by going to  People  &gt;  Employees . Click on the employee's name, open the quick edit window and then press  Add  under Contracted availability. This will open up the Contracted availability window. You can select the days and mark specific time intervals during those days when an employee should be available for scheduling.   🧩 In the above example, an employee should work on the following days: Mondays and Tuesdays, from 9 am to 5 pm, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10 am to 6 pm, and then Fridays from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm. You also need to specify when these settings should come into effect by setting a  Valid from  date. That way, you can keep track of an employee's availability even if their work pattern changes over time or if you need to add a new availability but have it apply from a particular time in the future. Using Contracted availability in the Schedule You can then navigate to the Schedule and create a new Shift. When assigning a Shift to an employee, a green symbol will indicate the presence of Contracted availability for this employee. You can hover over this symbol to see when the employee is contracted to work.  💡Regardless of Contracted hours, you can still schedule the employee for work outside these hours.   Need more help?

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 This article is for Admins and Schedule managers. Get familiar with  creating shifts  to make full use of this feature. What are Schedule filters? Schedule filters allow you to identify specific shifts, colleagues, or groups on your schedule. Filters can be applied to all views and timeframes of the schedule, allowing you better insight while creating or viewing schedules. 💡 Filters don't modify the schedules, which means you can review and explore your filters without worrying about changes to the schedule. How to apply filters on the schedule The  Filters  button is located at the top right of the Schedule page. Click on it to reveal the panel showing you all the available filter options.   You can apply the following filters on the schedule: Employees  - Filter by selecting a single employee or select multiple employees. You can also filter by Sections within the employee filter. Positions  - If you use  Positions , you can filter the schedule based on your added Positions and Sections only. Employee groups  - Filter based on  Employee groups . Shift type  - This setting lets you filter for shifts from various  Shift types  such as Normal, Sick, Leaves, or any other custom shift types. Status  - This lets you filter shifts between Shift states such as  Open ,  Requested ,  Not requested, Assigned, Approved,  and  For sale. Shift times  - Filter by specifying shift start and end timings. For example, you can type 8 in  From  to show all shifts starting from 8:00 in the morning.   Tips for using filters Save time by using the keyboard shortcut Shift + F to open or close the filter drawer quickly. You can simultaneously apply multiple filter options to narrow down only the shifts you would like to see. Use the search bar within the filters to find the desired results quickly. You can also print the schedule, with filters applied, by going to  Tools  &gt;  Print schedule. Your selected filters will remain applied to your account as a browser setting. If you browse away from the Schedule page with the filters applied, your filter selections will stay if you return to the page. Lastly, you will find an option to  hide the empty rows  of the schedule, so you can focus on the shifts you have selected and an option to clear all your filters by pressing  Reset all , to show everything again.

Familiarise yourself with the  Scheduling on Planday here . 💡  If you as an employee are using Planday to request Open shifts, Swap your shifts, transfer or hand over shifts, visit the articles  Open shifts  or  How to swap, transfer or hand over shifts .   What are Open shifts? On Planday, it is possible to create shifts without assigning them to specific employees. These type of shifts are called  Open shifts .    Open shifts can be helpful if you want to plan a Shift where employees can request work based on their role, skill set and preference.   How to create Open shifts? To create an Open shift, proceed like you would when creating a Normal shift, but do not assign it to an employee.   In the  Employee view , create an  Open shift  in the top row of the Schedule. If you create the Shift in an employee's row, you can select Open shift as the first option from the employee drop-down list.   The Open shift will be the default selection when creating a Shift in the  Groups or Positions view .   Once an Open shift has been created, it appears highlighted in red 🔴 on the Schedule. Only employees assigned to the corresponding Employee group can request the Open shifts created for those roles. The Shift remains open and un-assigned until an  admin or a Schedule manager  approves the request.   Swaps, Handover and Sell Shifts Employees can  Swap, Handover or Sell  their shifts amongst colleagues within the same Employee group and Department. Shifts remain assigned to an employee until a colleague and manager confirm the action. Swap  - allows an employee to exchange their Shift with another colleague and take one of theirs with mutual agreement. Transfer  - enables an employee to give away a shift directly to a colleague with mutual agreement. Sell  - allows staff to request their colleagues to take over their Shift. 💡 A shift marked for sale appears to other staff as an Open shift. Before the  request reaches you , the action must be confirmed by the colleague (for exchange or handover), or the on-sale Shift must be requested (for handover).   Optional notification settings By default, Planday will notify you of each request - so no action can be taken without your consent.    If you want to set up how staff can swap or book shifts specifically, or if and when your confirmation is required, navigate to  Settings  &gt;  Schedule  section &gt;  Swap Settings .   It is recommended to make changes here with great caution for controlled scheduling.   Note:  To ensure that a manager always approves open shift requests, swaps, or handovers, put a high number, like 50000, in the three fields highlighted above. If no manager approval is needed, simply put 0 in these fields.   How to process Shift approval requests To do this, navigate to the  Pending Requests  section from  Schedule  &gt;  Pending   Requests .   You can also get there directly from the  Pending actions  widget if it is added to your Planday dashboard.   You can switch between the  Swap requests  (Swaps and Handovers) and  Shift requests  (Open Shifts Requests) sections. You can filter by departments via the drop-down list to narrow down further if needed.   Swap Requests  - Click the pencil icon ✏️ ( Edit)  on the right of the action's row. In the edit window, you can optionally assign a Shift type to the Shift in question and  Approve  or  Reject  it. Shift requests  - In the Assigned Employee column, click  Assign Employee . You will then see the employees who have applied to take over the Shift. If there is more than one, select one by clicking their name and confirm with  Assign .   Approving Shift requests via the Planday app Pending actions can also be handled in the  Planday app . You can see them under the  Requests  widget.   Swap requests In the example below, a Shift swap is approved: To do this, tap on  Swap and handovers , select the request, and tap on  Confirm  or  Reject . ⬇️   Shift requests Approve requests for shifts on sale   ⬆️ The example above shows you how to process a shift request for a  shift on sale . From the Overview screen, tap on  Shift requests.  Then, select the request for the shift on sale (1.). Tap on  Employee  (2.)to choose the employee you'll give the shift to (either one of the employees who booked the shift or another employee who's available for this shift). Approve Open shift requests   ⬆️ The example above shows how to process a shift request for an  open shift . From the Overview screen, tap on  Shift requests.  Then, select the request for Open shift (1.). Tap on  Employee  (2.)to choose the employee you'll give the shift to.

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For Admins and Schedule Managers. Set up Punch Clock  to make full use of this feature. This article is intended for users who haven't imported an award via our  Award library . Prior to setting up Deviation Rules in Planday, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business. Please also note that overriding the breaks or hours required for your employee could be in breach of your compliance obligations. You should seek independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.     Punch Clock deviation rules can help you automate some of your administrative tasks for shifts that differ from their scheduled punch times. Once you have configured the rules, Planday keeps track of your employees' hours and the changes between their actual working hours and their scheduled hours. The deviations will show as suggestions along the rest of the shift in the  timesheet approval  to be approved by an admin or schedule manager.   With deviation rules, you can configure Planday to automatically: differentiate the hours worked before or after the scheduled hours. track and calculate the average of the deviations in working hours, for each employee, over time. calculate the effect on salary at the end of a salary period, for each employee. Note:  The use of  Rounding rules  in your Punch Clock may conflict with the application of deviation rules. You may need to turn them off or configure Rounding rules to start only with carefully calculated durations. Create a deviation rule To begin with, create a deviation rule by going to  Settings  &gt;  Punch Clock  &gt;  Advanced  &gt;  Deviations from scheduled time  &gt;  Create.       Configure a deviation type After clicking on  Create , you can choose which scenarios you want to track and what you want to happen when the selected scenario occurs. You can make changes at a later time if the initial setup does not suit your scheduling needs.     Name  - This will be used as the name displayed in the deviation rules list. Choose something descriptive, that can remind you what the rule is used for at a quick glance. As an example, you could name a rule that tracks when an employee leaves after the end of a shift, as &quot;After-shift overtime&quot;   Deviation type  -   The different deviation types describe different scenarios where you can define what should happen when the scenario occurs. Below you can read more about what the different types are used for. Note:  Rules concerning  shift length  always have the  highest priority  in comparison to other types. When a rule related to the shift length has been matched with a shift, all other rules will be ignored for this shift. Final shift type  - Defines the  Shift type  that will be applied to the new shift made by the deviation. For example, if an employee stamps out too late, it can generate overtime according to a deviation rule. See the example below for this use case.   Minimum length  - Defines the minimum number of minutes the deviation must be before this rule processes it. 0 means that the rule affects all deviations.   Start of shift  - Defines from where in a deviation this rule should start, as time in minutes. 0 means that the rule should apply to the whole deviation.   Length  - Defines how long a deviation of this rule should be treated, as time in minutes. 60 would mean 1hr.   Depending on your requirements, you can choose to limit your Deviation Rules to only apply under certain conditions. You can set them using the following settings. By default, the rule applies to  All  shifts and employees.   Shift types  - Apply the rule only to specific  Shift types .   Departments  - Apply the deviation rule only to certain  Departments .   Employee groups  - Limit the deviation to only certain groups of employees by selecting an  Employee group .   Employee types  - Apply the rule only to some  Employee types .   Remember to click on  Save  and continue the same process for all desired Deviation rules that you create.   Example of a Shift length exceeded deviation rule To show how deviation rules work in practice, here is an example with the type  Shift length exceeded .   First, the rule is created by going to  Settings  &gt;  Punch clock  &gt;  Advanced  &gt;  Deviations from scheduled time  &gt;  Create .     This deviation type is used when you want to specify what should happen when employees have been at work for too long. You want to count their hours as overtime by applying a Shift type. Note:  In this example, the  Shift type  Overtime (100%) is applied to record overtime hours.  The  Minimum length  is set to 15. This is the minimum number of minutes the shift must be exceeded before the rule takes effect.   The  length  is set to 120 minutes which indicates that the rule is valid for up to 2 hours.     Example shift with deviation rule applied in Timesheets &amp; Schedule   ⬆️ In the example above, the employee has a shift from 4 pm - 9 pm. He stamps in 30 minutes before the start of the shift and stamps out 35 minutes after the end time of the shift. This gives a total of 1 hour and 5 minutes affected by the above deviation rule.   Under  Timesheets   (1) &gt; click on the timesheet entry (2) ,  you can see how the shift is divided up if the deviation rule is used. The first 5 hours have the shift type  Normal  and the remaining time of 1.05 hours has automatically been given the shift type  Overtime  (3).    When the shift is approved, you can see the division in the shift schedule as shown below:     Need more help?   Please search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our ▶️  video tutorials .

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents The dashboard is the first page that you or your employee see when they open Planday on a web browser. It pulls important performance metrics from your existing data and brings actionable items in front of you so you can respond to the most important tasks first. Dashboard menu You can access most areas of Planday via the menu bar. Some options may not be available to you depending on your account’s subscription or user's  access level . For example, normal employees won't see the payroll, reports or account tabs.    Edit dashboard You can add relevant widgets or remove the ones you no longer need by clicking on the  Edit dashboard  button. For example, you can disable the Get Started widget if you no longer need it or add new widgets that are relevant to you.  Account widget Under the account section, you can manage your account information and your subscription. Simply press  Go to your account  to see your account overview. Pending actions widget The  Pending actions  widget can be considered your digital to-do list in Planday. It lets you know how many items are pending and require your attention, divided into four main categories: Swap requests  - Shift swaps in between your employees that need your approval. Shifts requested  - See when employees have applied to open shifts that need your approval. Punch Clock entries  - Finished shifts from Punch Clock that require your approval. Absence/Leave requests  - Take action when employees request time off and need your approval. Each category will show you how many requests you have awaiting action. If you press on a category, you'll be redirected to the request page where you can approve or deny it.   News widget Sharing information with your employees can be done through the news feed. You can also think of it as a bulletin board where you can post messages for the team. Press  Go to news  to see an overview of the news feed. Here you can edit existing news or create new posts targeted at different Departments or Employee groups.   Events widget You can schedule events for your employees that can be used to organise work meetings or social events directly from Planday that require attendance. Press  Go to events  to see an overview of all the events as well as create new ones. When you create an event, you can specify the date and time of the event, as well as limit the attendance by departments or employee groups. If you enable the  Use attendance  feature, your employees can let you know whether they can attend your event or not.   Birthdays widget The Birthdays widget has a more social role as it will let you and your employees see whose birthday is coming up in the next week. The Birthdays widget collects data from the date of the birth field from the employee's profile and displays it only to employees in the same Department.   Salary percentage widget Here you can see the salary percentage for one department and compare it across departments. The data is obtained by having a set revenue in the system together with an approved shift schedule so that the percentage can be calculated on the basis of the ratio between revenue and wages within a period.   Under the  Configure  button, you can select the department you want to see the salary percentage for and whether you want to compare it with your budget or another department. Revenue widget To bring out data in this widget, there must be some revenue numbers in Planday. You can set up your revenue either by going to  Reports  &gt;  Revenue  or via  Settings  &gt;  Reports  &gt;  Revenue . Both of these allow you to enter your revenue manually. You can also automate the revenue ingestion using a supported Point of Sale (POS) integration. Go to  Settings  &gt;  Integrations  to see supported POS integrations with Planday. Under the Configure button, you can select the department you want to see revenue for and whether you want to compare the data with another department. Daily attendance widget With Daily attendance, you can quickly get an overview of the punched-in times for the day. The yellow colour indicates deviations in the stamp times compared to the planned shift times. Need more help?   Please search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our ▶️  video tutorials .

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For advanced admins with full access to Planday. What does a public holiday calendar do in Planday? Public holiday calendars let you manage your Payroll supplements for upcoming public holidays, cater for national and regional holidays and let you plan your schedule needs in a more informed manner. You can have your public holiday calendars show up directly in your schedule so it's easier for you to anticipate shift needs.   💡 If you are unsure of what leave and absence employment terms are correct for your business or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.   Step 1: Add one or more Public holiday calendars in Planday To add a holiday calendar to Planday, go to  Settings &gt; General &gt; Public holiday calendar &gt; Add public holiday calendar.     When adding a public holiday calendar for your business, you need to put a start and end date for the calendar. Set it from 01/01/2023 to 31/12/2023.    💡  Planday will be updating the System calendars by adding more dates for future years and you’ll need to  extend your public holiday calendar .     You can use the system calendars in Planday by selecting the appropriate calendar from the  Create from existing  dropdown. You can later modify and add further dates if needed. You can also leave the  Create from existing  field blank and build a calendar from scratch by adding the dates manually.   💡  The first calendar will be set as default and automatically assigned to all employees. You can edit the calendar later for each employee.   If your business operates in multiple regions, you can add the appropriate calendars for each state or territory. We advise you to select the calendar used by the majority of your employees, as default. That way, it will be auto-assigned to all employees, and you only need to manually update those employees that are entitled to a different calendar.   Step 2: Assign Public holiday calendars to your employees If you have added more than one public holiday calendar in Settings, you will need to assign the correct public holiday calendar to the employees that aren’t covered by the default calendar.  To assign a public holiday calendar to an employee navigate to  Employees &gt; Edit an employee &gt; go to the Employment tab &gt; select the appropriate public holiday calendar  in the dropdown and the valid from date and click save. 💡  Please note that you can’t pick a date in the future. 💡  Going forward, when you create a new employee in Planday, this employee will be automatically assigned the default calendar, which you can then edit in the employee’s profile.

          <attvalue for="2" value="Table of contents All Collections Leave, Overtime &amp; Vacation Overtime Overview of Contract rules and Overtime Overview of Contract rules and Overtime L Written by  Luke   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins setting up their Planday.  See how  Contracted hours are used on the schedule . Contract rules let you specify your employees’ contracted hours in order to guide your planning when creating schedules.   You’ll see a comparison of your employees’ scheduled and contracted hours right inside the schedule. Setting these rules allows for better insight into which employees have enough hours, which can be scheduled for additional hours, and which ones have exceeded their contract limit. This will also be helpful in the further review and approval process of Timesheets.   To better understand the different steps and processes of managing Contract rules and overtime in Planday, we recommend the following steps:      Step 1: Create or adjust a Contract rule   Create Contract rules Note:  If you have enabled an award from our award library you will have preconfigured contract rules already in place.  Click on  Create Contract rules  to learn more about this process.       Edit an existing Contract rule Note:  If you’ve already enabled  an Award in Planday ,  Contract rules  will be created automatically for Full-time, Part-time and Casual employees.  By visiting  Settings  &gt;  People  &gt;  Contract rules  you need to adjust the default values in the various rules and intervals to fit your business/employee agreements. Furthermore, you need to adjust the start date of the contract rule to match the first day of your business pay cycle to ensure alignment between periods   and to ensure overtime applies correctly.   Select the rule you want to edit by clicking on the  edit icon  to the right of the line with the rule's name.   Notes:   Some of the aspects of a Contract rule cannot be modified after the rule has been created and saved. Any changes to the base contract rule will only take effect from the date the change was made and going forward. How does changing a contract rule impact existing approved or non-approved shifts on the schedule? Only shifts created or edited after the change will adopt the new/updated contract rule. Any new shifts with the attached Contract rule will include the changes.   How can you update past and existing shifts on the schedule to reflect the revised contract rule changes? Any past or existing shifts on the schedule affected by a change to a contract rule will not automatically reflect the changes to those shifts. Here are two simple workarounds you can try: Apply a Schedule template: If you want to apply a new or revised contract rule to a specific period, you can apply a template to that period.  Edit and bulk change shift types: Another option is to edit the shift type for a selected number of shifts. After editing, you can bulk change them back to the original shift type. This allows you to make changes to the shift types as needed.   Step 2: Create Shift types Note:  If you’ve already enabled  an Award in Planday , you can skip this step and go to  Step 4 .   You can set up payroll supplements to automatically trigger for payment based on the shift type used.   For payroll supplements to trigger payment based on the use of a shift type, you’ll need to ensure you have all your required shift types set up beforehand. Learn more about setting up shift types in the article  Create and use Shift types .   Depending on when the payroll supplement needs to be triggered for payment will determine the supplement type that needs to be selected. Read more about setting up  Payroll Supplements .   Step 3: Create Payroll supplements for overtime Note:  If you’ve already enabled  an Award in Planday , you can skip this step and go to  Step 4 . You can set up Contract rule supplements and link them to a contract rule, so overtime rates will be calculated and added automatically.   Go to  Settings  &gt;  Payroll  &gt;  Payroll supplement Press the  Create  button under Payroll supplement and select  Contract rules supplement  from the drop-down menu. Create in Xero as:  ( This is only visible if you have an active integration with Xero. ) You can immediately create the supplement as an earnings rate in Xero or leave it to manually sync later in the integrations settings by following here:   Xero integration set-up: Step 2 . To create them in Xero immediately, choose either Ordinary Time or Overtime. Ordinary Time is for all your supplements that are not connected to overtime, such as penalty rates. Contract rule:  Option applicable when selecting Contract rules supplement. Select which Contract rule the supplement should apply to. Title:  Name of the supplement. Description:  ( optional ) Include a description of the supplement.  Hourly wage: %  will mean the supplement will be based on a percentage of the individual's hourly wage. $ (monetary)  will add a set monetary amount to supplemented hours. Payment period : This is relative to the chosen supplement. Reset frequency:  Select how often the count of hours for calculating the Payment period should reset. This governs whether the hours specified in the payment period refer to: Per day:  daily overtime. Per contract rule interval:  as specified in the Contract rule (e.g. weeks or months). Days of the week : Select what days of the week the supplement should be applicable. Days from the public holiday calendar:  If you've enabled an Award via our Award Library, the option  Calendar assigned to employee  will automatically be selected for the relevant supplements. If you haven't enabled an Award, you can either choose the option  Calendar assigned to employee  or a specific  Public holiday calendar  so that the system will pick the right days to apply the supplement. Valid from/to:  When does the supplement come into effect or end. Employee groups:  Select which Employee groups are eligible for the supplement. Employee types:  Select which Employee types are eligible for the supplement. Affects salaried employees:  If selected, the supplement will also affect those with a fixed salary rather than an hourly rate. This may not work with percentage-based supplements if the salary period hours are set to zero. Affected by breaks:  when this is checked, if there is an unpaid break, then the supplement will not apply to the time covered by the break. Enforced payment:  Enable this to ensure that the supplement is always added to the pay – even though other supplements are present in the same period of the shift. Allow over midnight:  Select if a shift goes over midnight, potentially into a day not selected as being covered by a supplement, should the supplement continue to apply on the hours that fall in the next day after midnight.   Step 4: Assign Contract rule to employee Once you have set up the Contract rules you will need to assign them to the employees to keep track of contracted hours and overtime.   To assign a Contract rule to an employee, go to the  People  page, hover over the employee’s name and select the pencil icon to  edit . From the  Employment  tab, find the  Contract rules  section   and click on  Add .    Select the Contract rule you wish to apply from the drop-down list or search for it. To set a ‘Valid from’ and ‘Interval start date’ for when the rule should start to apply, the date set will need to match the start date of the pay period the employee is allocated to (e.g. Weekly pay period of Monday to Sunday, start date needs to fall on a Monday).   Additionally, you can choose the  Interval start date  to establish when the measurement of this interval begins. For example, if the start date is set to 1 June with an interval length of 1 week and 38 total hours, we can then expect that 38 hours should be worked from the 1st to the 7th, the 8th to the 14th, and so on.   Note:   You can click on an applied Contract rule to see a summary of enforced values or press  Edit  to make changes such as when to apply the rule and any employee-specific customisations.

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For advanced admins with full access to Planday. If you’re unsure of the correct Award coverage for your company or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business. Update or extend a Public holiday calendar How do I add days specific to my business to a Public holiday calendar? Once a  public holiday calendar has been applied, you can use   the  edit holiday  function under  Settings &gt; Your organisation &gt; General &gt; Public holiday calendar  to add individual days, such as regional or local public holidays, change the starting hour for events or remove a holiday from the list.   How do I update or extend a holiday calendar? When new future or updated calendar dates are made by Planday to the System public holiday calendar, they are not automatically transferred to your custom-created Planday calendar(s). You will receive communication(s) on when these new future or updated calendar dates will be added to Planday and what steps you will need to take to ensure you are able to action these as needed for any Public holiday calendars you have created.   How to extend an existing calendar with the new updates: In  Settings  &gt;  General  &gt;  Public holiday calendars , click the icon on the right side (calendar with a link icon). Under &quot;Copy from&quot;, select the desired Planday System calendar to copy from. Under &quot;From date&quot;, select the date from which the update should apply. Press  Save . You can check that the changes have been added by clicking  Edit holidays  and finding the new dates added to the list of holidays.   What happens if I add or remove days from a Public holiday calendar? Will it affect past data? Yes, it will affect Payroll supplements both in the future and the past. We recommend using the ‘Lock pay period’ function to ensure changes are not made to past data. Learn more about  How to lock a payroll period . For example, you have a supplement called &quot;Overtime (Public Holiday)&quot; that is applied to a specific employee type and only to the days from the public holiday calendar.   If you add a day to the public holiday calendar, the supplement will be applied to that day and if you remove a day, the supplement will be removed from that day.    Unless the newly added public holiday needs to be taken into account, any existing leave requests or approved leave requests for the day in question won’t recognise the new public holiday. Therefore any existing/approved leave or pending leave requests will need to be declined.  This applies to both if the added/removed holidays are in the past or the future. Note:   Overriding the public holidays applicable to your employee(s) could be in breach of your compliance obligations. You should seek independent legal advice as appropriate for your business. How do I know if public holiday hours will be sent to Xero for eligible employees? To ensure public holiday hours are sent from Planday to Xero for eligible employees entitled to payment for not working on a public holiday, there are two available options: *Prerequisite - The setting  Include holidays in payslips  must be enabled in Xero for the public holiday(s) to be automatically generated. For further support on Xero, navigate to  Xero Central  or contact the  Xero Support team . Option 1:  In Xero, you’ll need to delete the timesheet for the impacted employee and move the hours of the public holiday to the public holiday pay item in the pay run. To learn more on Xero, navigate to  Xero Central  or contact the  Xero Support team . Option 2:  In Planday, navigate to  Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Overview  and click “Manage” under Xero. Scroll down to the section  Payroll , find the name of your Xero org and click on the pencil icon to edit. Click on  Add mapping  where you’ll be able to manually map the ‘Absent on Public Holiday’ shift type’s salary code to the appropriate Xero pay item.  Note:   Please ensure the relevant pay item has been created in Xero so it is available for mapping in Planday. To find the salary code of the shift type ‘Absent on Public Holiday’ go to  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Shift types. The salary code can be found in the third column from the left once you’ve located the ‘Absent on Public Holiday’ shift type.  This will ensure eligible employees not required to work on a public holiday have these hours sent to Xero for payment automatically through the integration.   Change the default calendar How do I change which public holiday calendar is the default? You can change which calendar is your organisation’s default calendar at any time and backdate the change if needed in the field  Valid from . Note:  Any employees who haven’t been assigned a specific calendar on their employee profile will be assigned the default calendar from the date you’ve assigned it. Backdating this change will affect past payroll data. Go to  Settings &gt; Your organisation &gt; General &gt; Public holiday calendars , and next to the calendar you wish to set as the new default, click  “Set as default”.  This will open a pop-up window prompting for a “Valid from” date.   Note:  Any existing default calendar will be valid until your latest change's “Valid from” date. How does this affect the existing default calendar? Please be aware of the following if you are changing the default calendar:   If you set the valid from date After  the existing default calendars “Valid from” date, then the existing default calendar will be the default  until the day before  the new default calendar is valid. Before  the existing default calendar’s “Valid from” date, then the existing default calendar  will be overridden  by the new default calendar. Note:   If you need to restore an overridden default calendar, then you would need to reach out to our support team via chat.   Display a holiday calendar on the schedule How can I display a holiday calendar on the schedule? If you've set up a new public holiday calendar you can enable it in the schedule by going to  Schedule &gt; View settings &gt;  and turning on  Public holidays / Leave.   All public holiday calendars created in your portal will now show up on your schedule including any custom holidays you have added.   I have two locations in different states, will the schedule show both public holiday calendars?  Yes, the schedule will reflect the days of public holiday calendars assigned to those employees.  You can see the name of each calendar, so for example “Labour Day”, from the calendar called “Queensland” will be displayed as “Labour Day (Queensland)”  Note:  Public holiday calendars will only show in the schedule if “Public holidays/Leave&quot; is enabled under  View Settings .   Delete a Public holiday calendar Can a holiday calendar be deleted from Planday? Deleting a calendar is not possible for the following reasons: to ensure data consistency for historical scheduling and payroll data to reduce the risk of deleting data by accident.   Warnings Why am I seeing a yellow warning saying there is no calendar available when I edit an employee? This means that no Public Holiday Calendar has been set up for your organisation. This is essential to ensure payroll is correct.   To create one, go to  Settings &gt; Your organisation &gt; General &gt; Public holiday calendar  and click “Add public holiday calendar”.   You can take a look at the following article  How to create and assign Public holiday calendars  to learn more about it. Why am I seeing a warning saying the calendar has expired when I edit an employee? This warning is displayed if the calendar that is assigned to the employee, or the default calendar, is expired. For example, there are no more upcoming holidays in it. You would then need to update the relevant Public holiday calendar.   Go to  Update or extend a Public holiday calendar  to make an update and add new dates to the existing calendar. Need more help?

Prior to going through this article, we suggest following the steps in our article  How to set up your employees with supported Awards . If you are unsure of what leave and absence employment terms are correct for your business or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business. Please note  that leave balances displayed in Planday are only estimates and you and your employees are always advised to check Xero Payroll for exact leave account balances. We encourage you to perform regular reviews and audits of leave accruals and balances to ensure your business is meeting your obligations as an employer with respect to your employees’ entitlements. Description of the leave account templates There are six pre-configured account templates in Planday that will automatically be set up to only be available to the applicable employee types from the selected Award.  You can then apply them to your employees to give them access to request leave. To see these account templates, go to  Settings  &gt;  Leave  &gt;  Account templates . If mapped correctly in the Planday Xero integration, this record will make sure leave hours can be synced to Xero Payroll, meaning any leave requested and approved within Planday will be deducted from your employee’s balance in Xero when you conduct your pay run.  Follow this link  to map your leave types. Available templates: The “Annual leave (paid)” leave account template is available to Full-time and Part-time employees. The “Compassionate leave (paid)” account template is available to Full-time and Part-time employees. The “Compassionate leave (unpaid)” leave account template is available to Casual employees. The “Personal / Carer’s leave (paid) account template is available to Full-time and Part-time employees The ”Personal / Carer’s leave (Unpaid)” account template is available to all employees. “Unpaid leave” is available to all your employee types. Note:  Whilst you are able to make changes to the templates, please note that overriding or changing these configurations could be in breach of your compliance obligations. You should seek independent legal advice as appropriate for your business. Please note that Planday focuses on the most common types of leave and absence and does not cover all of the leave and absence types, for example, Long Service Leave, Community Service Leave and Parental Leave. Please refer to this  Help Centre article  for more information about the leave and absence exclusions.  Modify the account template settings If you’d like to change any of the settings above to suit your business needs, go to  Settings &gt; Leave &gt; Account templates . Here you select the account in question and press to open it - or edit it via the pencil on the far right of the screen.   You can make changes to some of the settings such as: The  description  of the account: Optional field to add a description for the account. By default this is empty. Accrual period start date : This is the date from which employees start accruing leave on their account balances. The date can be adjusted similarly to the Template period below. Template period Start Date : This is the date from which the employees can request leave use the account. The accounts are by default valid from the 1st of January in the current year and for an unlimited period, which means the leave accounts do not expire and your employees keep the same account throughout their employment. This date can be changed on each employee’s account should the employee start later than the date set in the account template. Click on  Apply Leave Accounts to your employees  to find out how to do this. The  Apply automatically  checkbox: If you select this option, the system will automatically apply this Account template for all new and existing employees who match the selected options. This does not happen by default. It is advisable to confirm that all your employees belong to the right department, employee group and employee type before activating this. Accrual Policy : This section describes how your employees accrue leave for their leave account. Each template comes with a pre-defined accrual policy. Changes of the accrual policy will affect all existing employee leave accounts and their current balances. Requirements for accrual   Shift types: Control which shifts in schedule contribute to the accrued leave based on their shift types. Work hours per day   Assign If you previously set up Awards, leave templates will be applied to relevant employee types based on the Award. Make sure that employees are assigned the relevant employee type. Negative balance : Employees can by default apply for leave beyond the estimated balance of their leave account. The amount of extra days can be adjusted in the text field below the checkbox. Consecutive leave days :  Here you can set a restriction to the number of consecutive days of leave that an employee can request. You can select &quot;unlimited&quot;, which is the most common setting, or &quot;set fixed limit&quot;. When selecting &quot;unlimited&quot;, the administrator will still have to approve a holiday request and thus have the option to reject an extended holiday if necessary. By default, this is set to 2 days for Compassionate leave and switched off for the other types of leave. Payroll Salary code   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and HR Managers. Skip this step if you manage contracts outside Planday and  wish to send an existing contract to an employee. With the contract module in Planday, you can build or upload contracts directly in Planday and use data from the employee information to personalise the contracts. That way, you only need to create one contract per  Employee type ,  group  or  Department  and can send personal contracts to your new hires using the merge fields function. This guide covers the following topics to create or upload a contract.    Go to  Settings  &gt;  People  &gt;  Contract set-up  and press  Create  to set up a contract template.   Create a contract using Planday text editor Start by giving a unique  name  to the contract. Choose which Employee groups can use this contract and set a category for this contract (optional).   Type  The  Insert text  function allows you to type the content of your contract directly into the text editor. You can use the text editor to stylize your contract and use employee data from your Planday to fill in certain fields.   The  Import Document  function allows you to upload an existing Microsoft Word document with the correct layout according to your company’s layout and use employee data from your Planday to fill in certain fields.   Merge Fields  No matter the type of contract you create, you can automatically merge each employee's information into the contract using  merge fields .    You can find a list of available merge fields   in the section below the text box with example data associated with the employee. See this  detailed document on merge fields  describing each value and their equivalent Danish values in case your Planday was set up in another language.    If entered into Planday’s editor, note that the merge fields should be spelt as they are in Planday. Be sure to use  &lt; &gt;  if using Planday text editor or remove &lt; &gt; if using Microsoft Word to compose your contract. Any custom data fields that you may have created, such as  visa information ,  COVID compliance , will have a  custom_  prefix to them and can be used in the contract.    💡  If you are missing a merge field,   create a new field  for the employee information page by going to  Settings  &gt;  People &gt;  Employee form setup . Once you have created a new field, it will appear on the employee's profile. Then enter a value in this field before using the merge field.   Upload   file Logo  (This option only appears if selecting the Insert text function) If you have chosen to compose your text in the Planday text editor, you can import a company logo and embed it into the digital contract with the option to position it.   Document  (This option only appears if selecting the Import document function) This allows you to upload an existing *.doc document with your layout and text. We recommend the file be in Word format so you can use the merge fields and thus get the most out of the contract module in Planday. See the complete list of  predefined merge fields here.   Generate test contract If you want to see how the contract looks, you can preview it by  generating a test contract . This test contract fetches data from your profile and shows you what the contract may look like for the employee using your information.   Import your document using merge fields in Microsoft Word If you want to include information from Planday in your self-managed contracts, such as employee and company information, then you must choose  Import document  for  Type . This lets you import your company’s contract into Planday and customise it for your employee.  ⚠️ Note: The following examples use Microsoft Word for macOS, and these steps may differ slightly in other Word versions or on Windows.  To add Planday information to your external contract, open your contract in  Word  and create a new merge field. You can do that by going to the  Insert  menu and pressing the  Insert a Field  button or the menu bar in  Word  &gt;  Insert  &gt;  Field.   Inside  All  categories, look for  MergeField  from the list and select it (you can press “m” twice after selecting All to jump to the MergeFrield quickly). You can now enter the name of the field you wish to merge with the employee’s data  with its corresponding value from Planday . Be sure  not  to include &lt; or &gt; in your value.   To add more merge fields, copy and paste an existing merge field and then rename it according to the following instructions (or see the animation below): Double-click / right-click on the object and select  Toggle Field Codes . You can name the new field accordingly before updating (double-click / right-click on the object and select the  Update field ). You should copy the merge field from Planday and paste it into Word instead of entering it manually to minimize errors. Remember to save. After this, the field will appear in the contract template in Word and you can upload the contract file in Planday. Once all the desired merge fields have been created and the contract template has been uploaded to the system, you are ready to send it to your employees.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For Admins and HR Managers.    Before assigning a contract to an employee, consider  setting up contract templates.  This allows you to set up a template of how your contracts can be applied to multiple users using information from their Planday profile with your company’s standard contract rules. Set Contract templates by going to  Settings  &gt;  People  &gt;  Contract setup.   Assign a contract to an employee   Once at least one contract template is ready, you can create and send a personal contract to an employee. This can be done in two ways: From the Contracts overview screen You can create a contract from the contract overview screen by going to  People  &gt;  Contracts  &gt;  Create contract.   By editing an employee You can also create a contract for an employee from the employee edit screen by going to  People  &gt;  Employees &gt;  press the employee name &gt;  Edit  &gt; scroll to the  Documents  tab and press  Create  under  the contract  section.   Regardless of the path you took to get to the create button, you will reach the Create contract screen. Select the employee’s primary  Employee group  to merge the salary information with the contract. Select a contract template that you may have created. Select the  Contract start date  and a contact person, such as yourself or an HR manager as a supervisor. Click  Next  to compose the contract.   On the next screen, you will see, depending on your selection of contract: A blank text editor to compose your contract. A filled-in contract template that you selected from the previous step that you can further edit if you need. An attached uploaded document with merge fields that you may have selected while creating your contract.   If you are satisfied with the content of the contract, click on  Save . You also have the option to download this contract as a PDF file for safekeeping. The next step highlights the employee that needs to sign the document, shows the creation date of this document, along with expiry date (if applicable), status and two signing options:   Manually : Select this option if the document needs to be signed on paper (printed out) or has already been signed, and a copy should be uploaded for safe keeping with the option to leave comments.    Electronically : Select this option if you want the employee to sign the document electronically through Planday.   If you choose  Electronically , you must complete one more step before sending the document to your employee to collect their signature. You must first sign the document as the employer.  Allow access to Planday before signing contract Secondly, a decision should be made regarding access to use Planday (and the app) for that employee before they sign the contract:  Yes  means your employee can access Planday whether they sign the document or not. You can set reminders to notify employees to sign the contract later. No  means that when an employee opens Planday through the app, they will be notified that they have a document to sign. They will be guided to read and sign the contract before being allowed further. Select  No  if you want your employees to be made aware automatically when they open their Planday app that they have documents to sign. When done, press  Sign and send to employee  to sign the contract yourself and send it to the employee.  The contract will now be sent to the employee, and you can see it on your Contract overview under  People  &gt;  Contracts  under the  Awaiting action  section.   You will be notified as soon as the employee has signed the document, which will then move under the  Signed contracts  section. 💡  If you have an already signed a contract that was created outside of Planday, you can also import this on the employee's profile under  Employees  &gt; edit employee &gt;  Documents . See more about  uploading files and documents here .   Contract notifications and reminders To avoid chasing your employees for contract signatures, you can enable notifications and reminders that can be sent automatically.  Employee contracts  allow you to send an SMS or Planday message to specified employees when they receive a new contract that needs to be signed.  Contract reminders  will send a notification if they have failed to sign a contract after a set time. To set up either of these features, go to  Settings  &gt;  Your organisation  &gt;  Notifications .   You can also add a reminder for contract expiration in case the created contract has had an expiration date.   Need more help?

This may be caused by the employee name having a space before the first name or after the last name. Once this space has been removed the spaceman should no longer occur.    The spaceman can also appear if the contract file has a long name and/or filename has special characters in the name.   MergeFields not working as intended There can be a couple of reasons why the  MergeFields  may not work as intended. It can be because:  the value is blank in the employee data  it can be caused by the wrong input field in the document / inserted text.   Salary field not merging  If the salary field keeps coming out blank it might be because the wage is not inserted for the employee in question or, the field itself has been pasted incorrectly. If no value for salary was inserted, the salary code appears in its place.   The logo is not showing up when using the insert text function to generate a contract This feature is currently being upgraded and may have some technical issues. As an alternate, you can compose your contract in a Microsoft Word document allowing you to add your logo and use merge fields to embed Planday fields. When you upload the contract it would appear with the logo and fetch key employee data in the contract document.   Can we create bulk contracts? Not at the moment.

A few examples include: Personal documents:  These can be manually signed papers, supplement contracts, criminal records, and work permits can be added to individual employee profiles. Contracts:  These can be electronically signed records between employees and managers. These include job contracts or device lending contracts.  Notes  such as comments from a meeting can be attached to an employee's profile. You can then decide on the visibility of the note and keep it private or visible to other managers. General   documents  such as staff handbooks and policies, manuals, and tutorials can be shared with employees individually or with an Employee group. Upload personal documents for an employee You may need to upload private documents that only you or the employee can access. These can be HR-related files, such as manually signed documents, supplement contracts, work permits, scans of visa records etc. You can upload these documents inside the employee's profile by going to  People  &gt;  Employees  &gt; edit the employee you wish to add the file to &gt;  Documents  &gt; scroll down to the  Files  section &gt; click  Upload.   As a manager, you can set values for the expiry of the document and decide if the file should be accessible by the employee or not.   💡 See a  list of supported file formats for documents for upload .

Have employees check private files and signed documents Depending on the file's visibility settings, employees can view files on Planday web by going to  Profile  &gt;  Edit.  These can be contracts that need signing or files containing personal data.    Where to upload signed contracts You can upload signed files between you and the employees such as employment contracts on an employee’s profile. You can use the contract setup function in Planday to create your contracts or upload signed documents manually.  You can get an overview of existing contracts or create new ones by going to  People  &gt;  Contracts.   Here you can see the status of all contracts including those  awaiting action , or  signed contracts  by employees.

And most importantly, you can mark if the note should be  visible to the employee  or admins only. If visible to employee is selected, you can notify the employee by Planday message or an SMS.   Employees can view these notes on Planday, depending on the note’s visibility, by going to their  Profile  &gt;  Edit.   Share general documents with all employees or groups 💡  If you are looking for an alternative for announcements or sharing information, consider the  News feature  on your dashboard.

These can be staff handbooks, company policies, user manuals, tutorials, etc. You can also upload files other than documents, such as staff party pictures, menu items, or photos and share them with specific employee groups or teams. Start by going to  People &gt; Documents  for an overview of existing files.  Before uploading files, create a new folder under Documents and set which employee groups can access that folder. Then press  Upload files  to add your shared documents to this new folder.    Employees can now view these shared files by going to  People  &gt;  Documents  on Planday web or by going to  More  &gt;  Documents  &gt;  General  on the Planday app.   Need more help?

It provides an overview of the relevant functionality in Planday and the content of Planday’s built-in award interpretation feature (“Award library”) for the Fast Food Industry and links to additional guides to ease the set-up process of a Planday organisation. If you’re unsure of the correct Award coverage for your company or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the Fair Work Ombudsman to discuss this further.

Changing or overriding award configurations Set out below is how Planday configures award requirements relating to contract rules, break rules, shift types and overtime. Whilst you are able to change the hours or rules specified, please note that overriding or changing these configurations could be in breach of your compliance obligations. You should seek independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago The Planday product is designed to support and simplify award interpretation through digitisation, but it is not intended to be a compliance product or to relieve you of your legal obligations in relation to compliance.

You also take sole responsibility for overriding any of the award requirements set out in the Planday product. Therefore, it is important that you familiarise yourself with the relevant legal requirements and seek your own independent legal advice in order to ensure that the Planday product is suitable for the needs of your business and your employee types.

          <attvalue for="2" value="Table of contents All Collections Get started Planday video tutorials for admins and managers Planday video tutorials for admins and managers Here is a collection of basic tutorials to help you get started with setting up and using Planday daily. Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and Schedule managers. Are you an employee using Planday? See  Planday video tutorials for employees . This article will show you how to configure different parts of Planday by taking you through short guided tutorial videos.   This guide is best suited for Admins of Planday that have full access to change all settings. However, users with other access levels, such as Schedule managers or HR managers, may find these guides helpful if they need to use Planday daily. Read more about  assigning Access levels here .   Getting Started How to log in to Planday from a web browser or the Planday app You need to have three pieces of information to log in to Planday. Planday URL:  This is the URL that you will need to go to on the web version to log in to Planday. Username:  This would be the  email address  that you received the initial email invitation. Password:  The password you set up by clicking the confirmation sent in your email. You and everyone on your team will use these three items to log in on the app and web versions of Planday.   How to create, edit or delete Departments Use  Departments  to separate different work areas and keep your schedules organised and efficient.   You may have multiple schedules in your Planday set-up and, therefore, would need multiple departments. Departments can also be seen as different locations of your business or different areas within your business.   How to make Employee groups Employee groups  in Planday are, effectively, job roles. Employee groups hold the pay rate for the employee and allow employees to work in multiple roles. They are also needed to create  Positions  on the Schedule.   Employee groups could be based on role and seniority, allowing you to automatically track the skills and experience necessary for your shifts and ensuring that your scheduling needs are met.   How to create and invite employees Populating your Planday is a basic step to getting your schedule up and running. First,  create employees  by filling in their data. Then assign them to a Department and add them to Employee groups. Finally, invite the employee to Planday to give them access to their schedule.   How to schedule Assuming you have created departments, created job roles in groups, and invited your employees to Planday, it is time to bring it together. Go to the Schedule page and start  creating shifts  for your employees.   Using Planday How to create and use Schedule templates Schedule templates  are the next stage of scheduling and allow you to plan and schedule weeks in advance. By creating a default schedule template, using a mixture of assigned and open shifts, you can create a flexible template that can be applied up to 14 times in one go. This will reduce your scheduling time and allow you to plan more effectively, giving you and your employees a clear view of who is working when.   How to set up Open shifts Open shifts in your schedule are shifts that are not yet assigned to a specific employee. You can set the start and end time, select the specific employee group and position, define the kind of shift you know you need to fill, and leave it open. The shift will be displayed as a placeholder on the schedule. Your employees can then request to take this open shift if they match the Department and Employee group required by the shift type.   How to troubleshoot logging in to Planday There are three details you need to log into Planday: The company's Planday URL which is the same as the URL of your organisation Remember to exclude www or HTTP before adding the URL in the app companyname.planday.com. You can also log in to Planday by visiting  https://www.planday.com/login/ A correct username in the form of an email address that you received your Planday invitation. Didn't get the email? Please check the junk mail folder, as the invitation may have landed there. and a strong password. If you are having difficulties logging in, there's most likely an issue with one of the above details.   One of the most common reasons is the username not matching the email, which can be  changed through the Employee profile.  For this change to take effect, the  employee has to confirm this action  by clicking a confirmation link sent to their email, which might have ended up in their junk mail folder.   How to assign hourly wages to employees Wages are attached to the Employee group of an employee. This allows employees to belong to multiple employee groups but have different pay rates per group if necessary. Wages can be edited in bulk or assigned individually and can be backdated or set to automatically apply in the future.   How to set fixed salaries for your employees Salaries differ from wages as they do not rely on Shift data. The salary is fixed and applies by default on a monthly basis. You can also set the pay period to weekly, bi-weekly and 4-week intervals. You can choose the allocation method for the salary cost distribution across your schedule. This can be set to an hourly amount, dividing the salary by contracted or worked hours to find an hourly value or by days to find a daily value.   How to communicate with staff via Planday messaging Within Planday, you can communicate with the staff directly through  Messaging  without having to know their phone number or email. You can message a specific employee, employee group, an entire department, or your entire Planday organisation. Employees will receive an app notification (and an email notification if the option is enabled), letting them know they have a message waiting for them.   You can share information through the Newsfeed and the Events tab to keep your staff updated with general matters. You can also force a reply should you require an answer from your employees.   How to set Access levels and give employees additional roles Access levels  describe the specific levels of access within Planday where you can give additional authority to an employee to perform specific managerial tasks. By default, there are three access levels: Schedule manager, HR manager, and Administrator. The access areas for each level are outlined in a table in this  article . The access level Account admin is typically assigned to an admin that sets the Planday company account and is responsible for billing/subscription.   How to set up the Punch Clock The Punch Clock allows you to bridge the gap between paying for the scheduled time and precise worked time. Punch Clock can be set up in the following ways for employees to clock in or out. For checking in online from a web browser based on pre-defined IP addresses For checking in using the Planday app within a specified radius For checking in from a physical location without IP or phones using the Kiosk app   Advanced Features How to create and use Shift types The most common use for  Shift types  is for recording sickness on the schedule and reporting this data for payroll reports. Shift types can also be used to change the rates of a shift or add an additional payment. This is handy when you need to pay different rates for evening or weekend shifts.   How to create a schedule using Positions and Sections Positions and sections allow you to plan your schedule without having to schedule by employees. This allows flexibility in your scheduling, highlighting your schedule gaps by position instead of by staff.   How to set up Contracts for electronic signatures You can send out Contracts or any other documents your employees need to sign through Planday. Employees cannot add information to these Documents, they can only sign them. These files are saved on their profile and can be reviewed later.   Xero and Planday Integration Step 1:  Add Xero Integration to Planday &amp; Sync employee data Using  Planday and Xero  together gives you a robust solution for staff scheduling, availability, wage costs, compliance, absence management, time tracking, payroll, reporting, and more.

We recommend the following article  here  to enable the manual setup of an employee’s hourly rate should you wish.  It’s important to always check the Award and Fair Work’s  Pay and Conditions Tool (PACT)  if you’re unsure of the correct classification(s) to allocate to your business. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. Alternatively contact the Fair Work Ombudsman to discuss this in more detail. Ordinary hours This outlines and forms the foundational amount of hours worked by an employee before overtime is triggered, as described by the award. These are supported in Planday with ‘Contract rules’.   Contract rules You can define each individual employee’s ordinary hours by using Contract rules and visually see how you’re distributing the hours in the schedule. These rules set the foundation for applying overtime rates (covered further down). Action required:  Review your part time and full time employees ordinary hours of work in line with the relevant award clauses.  Map your employees to the correct contract rules, or create/customise rules relevant to your circumstances. Learn more in  this article .

Contract rule Weekly interval Max hours per day Full-time 38 hours per week 11.5 hours Part-time** 38 hours per week 11.5 hours Casual 38 hours per week 12 hours **Note that ‘Guaranteed hours’ is not supported in the ‘Contract rule’ feature. We recommend using ‘ Contracted availability ’ to define days and hours of your employees’ availability.  See full list of features still in development . Break rules By using ‘Break rules’ allows you to automatically apply a set of breaks to the shifts in your schedule according to award specifications. You can also add/remove additional breaks and edit them manually on a shift-by-shift basis. Learn more about  break rules in this article .   Automatic breaks Length of shift Type of Break(s) 5 hours or more and up to 10 hours 1 x 30 min unpaid meal break More than 10 hours 2 x 20 min paid rest break + 1 x 30 min unpaid meal break Action required: Review the pre-defined break rules under  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Breaks  and verify that the breaks are set up in accordance with how your business operates. Pay special attention to the start and end times of the breaks particularly when using the ‘Timesheets’ feature with pre-defined break rules. We encourage you to ensure you review disbursement of breaks in shifts in the ‘ Timesheets ’ feature and adjust them accordingly. Manual breaks Note : The settings of break rules only look at individual shifts and not the total hours per day. Please ensure you review the placement of rest and meal breaks in shifts allocated to employees and update as needed to meet your compliance obligations. The following scenario(s) can be completed using the ‘Timesheets’ feature once shifts have been completed. To learn more, click  here .   Meal break delayed or not taken If an unpaid meal break is delayed or not taken you’ll manually have to adjust the shift to ensure the 50% penalty is applied. This isn’t automated, and you’ll need to split the shift in the schedule.   To split a shift, you need to adjust the planned shift so it aligns with the hours worked up until the unpaid meal break should have been taken and remove the break. Next you need to add a separate shift with the shift type “Missed meal break” for the hours where penalties apply.   Steps: Go to the Schedule. Click on the Shift you need to split. Edit start and/or end time so it aligns with the worked hours up until the meal break was supposed to be held and remove the break. Click save. Create a new shift for the hours where penalties apply. Add start and end time, Shift type “Missed meal break”. Click save.   Where a meal break has been delayed, after adding in “Missed meal break” shift per the last above step: Create a new shift for the remainder of the hours worked Add start and end time, select the appropriate Shift type (I.e. “Normal”, “Overtime” etc.). Click save.   Shift types With ‘Shift types’ you can label particular shifts in the schedule that’s out of the ordinary. For example when an employee is on leave (Annual leave, Compassionate leave, etc.) or when an employee who normally works on the day a public holiday falls and is eligible for payment of their ordinary hours.

Contract rules You can define each individual employee’s ordinary hours, and span of hours or contracted/agreed hours of work (part time) and visually see how you’re distributing the hours in the schedule. These rules set the foundation for applying overtime rates (covered further down).   Planday has input example information into the contract rules section for part time and full time employees. Casual employees contract rules are as per the span of hours, and maximum working hours per day and per week as per the Award.  Please note the following businesses have varied ordinary hours that may be worked which will need to be updated appropriately by the business in the contract rules section for employees: from 5:00 am in a newsagency; or until midnight in a video shop; or until 11.00 pm if the trading hours of the establishment extend beyond 9.00 pm on a Monday to Friday or 6.00 pm on a Saturday or Sunday. Action required:  Review your part time and full time employees agreed/contracted hours of work in line with the relevant award clauses.  Map your employees to the correct contract rules, or create/customise rules relevant to your circumstances. Learn more in  this Help centre article .

Break rules By using ‘Break rules’ allows you to  automatically apply a set of breaks to the shifts in your schedule according to award specifications. You can also add/remove additional breaks and edit them manually on a shift-by-shift basis. Learn more about  break rules in this article . Length of shift Type of Break(s) that automatically apply More than 4 hours (but less than 5) 1 x 10 min paid rest break More than 5 hours (but less than 7) 1 x 10 min paid rest break + 1 x 30 min unpaid meal break More than 7 hours (but less than 10) 2 x 10 min paid rest break + 1 x 30 min unpaid meal break More than 10 hours 2 x 10 min paid rest break + 2 x 30 min unpaid meal break Action required: Review the pre-defined break rules under  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Breaks  and verify that the breaks are set up in accordance with how your business operates. Pay special attention to the start and end times of the breaks particularly when using the ‘Timesheets’ feature with pre-defined break rules. We encourage you to ensure you review disbursement of breaks in shifts in the ‘ Timesheets ’ feature and adjust them accordingly. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. Refer to the Award for more information on breaks or alternatively contact the Fair Work Ombudsman to discuss in more detail.   Shift types By using ‘Shift types’ you can label particular shifts.

We recommend that you have completed  Step 1  before proceeding with this article.    1. Create Contract rules Navigate to  Settings &gt; People &gt; Contract rules to  create a contract rule. You can create a contract rule for each of the employee types if the contracted hours vary between them. However, you also have the option to individualise it on each employee when applying the contract rule later.   Select the  shift types  that should count towards the employees’ worked hours. Then select which  employee types  this contract rule should be available for.    In the next section you need to choose a  start date  in the past. We recommend aligning this with your pay calendar, so if that starts on a Monday, select a Monday in the past.  Select an interval and define the hours per day/week/month/year. You can add additional rules to set a span of hours or set the maximum hours per day.     Read more about contract rules  here .  Tip:  You can also set up rounding settings for Punch Clock entries to track overtime. Read more about rounding settings  here . 2. Create shift type for different types of overtime Navigate to  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Shift types  to create a shift type for overtime. If you have different types of overtime that trigger different overtime rates, we recommend you create a shift type for each type.    Ensure that the appropriate settings are ticked.

Range: 1 week   Employee types: Part-time and Full-time    Payment days: Monday - Friday   4. Apply Contract rules to employees Once you have created the payroll supplements, you need to assign the contract rules to employees for the configuration to apply to staff.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For employees new to Planday. Also, see  Introduction to Planday web for employees  or watch  Planday video tutorials for employees . Welcome to Planday! Use this article to find your way around the various features of Planday mobile app. Download the Planday app If you have not done already,  download the Planday app  for free from your device's App Store by searching for  Planday Employee Scheduling . The app works on  iPhones  and  Android  devices.   You will need a  Planday URL  from your manager to log in. Your  username will be your email address,  and your  password  can be set up by  clicking the invite  sent by your manager to your email.   Overview After logging in, you will see an overview screen with information that matters to you the most. You will use this screen to  punch in  when you arrive at work and  punch out  when you finish your shift.   The overview screen also has a link to  your profile ,  assigned shifts , available  open shifts , company  news , or any upcoming  events. 💡 You can update your preferences for language, notifications, or personal details by tapping your Profile icon in the top right. Punch Clock You must  punch in  every time you start your shift, go on a break, and leave for the day. When punching in and out, your actual working time will be counted so that you get paid for the exact amount down to the minute!   Remember to add a comment when clocking in or out if you were late for your shift or if you went overtime. This way, your manager can approve your hours with the correct hours.   Your shifts Here you can see a quick overview of  upcoming shifts  assigned to you. Please tap on a shift to see who your colleagues will be that day, where you will be working and any shift-related notes your manager has left for you. If enabled by your Planday admin, you can  swap, handover or sell your shift  to your colleagues. Open shifts Open shifts are available shifts that are up for grabs. These can also include shifts put on sale by your colleagues. You can ask to take these  open and available shifts  by pressing  Request shift . Usually, a manager has to approve your request before the shift can be yours.   News &amp; Events Messages or important updates posted by your team manager or company show up under the  News section . It could be information regarding new policies, staff changes, or a quick note informing you of anything relevant to your work.   Your managers can also create event invites that require attendance and reservation. These events allow you to mark if you are attending or not.   Messages Planday has a powerful  messenger  built into the app, allowing you to communicate with your colleagues without remembering their contact details. You can use this system to send direct messages to your colleagues, communicate with your team or send company-wide messages.   Besides messages from your team, you will also receive Planday alerts here regarding updates to your shifts, changes to the schedule or swap requests. Requests for shift swaps &amp; requests Under requests, you have an overview of your colleague's requests for  shift swaps and requests . You can accept or decline the exchange from here or see the status of your requests. Generally, shift swaps need to be approved by your manager before they are final. Availability You can mark when you are available to work and when you cannot.  Availability  makes it easier for schedule managers to offer you open shifts or see if you are free for work. Profile &amp; language settings Tap on your profile icon from the Overview screen to enter your Profile section. Here you can set a new  profile picture , change your Planday account's  language , disable  notifications  from the app, or sync your shifts to an  external calendar .   Need more help?   Contact your company's Planday administrator or manager first if you need help with any feature. Alternatively, search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our  video tutorials .

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago 🎯  For employees. As an Admin or Schedule manager, find out  How to process Shift approval requests . When you select one of your future shifts you’ll see the option to  Swap ,  Hand over , or  Sell  the shift on an iOS device or under the + button on Androids. A  Swap  request allows you to exchange shifts with a colleague. They'll get your shift, you'll get their shift. Perfect for swapping an early start for your colleague's late one. A  Hand over  request allows you to give the shift directly to a colleague without replacing it. Use this when you have a specific person in mind to replace you when you can't make it to work. Use  Sell  to put the shift up for sale, giving your colleagues the chance to request it themselves. If you have a lot of peers in your role then this option will take the hassle out of finding a replacement when you can't work this shift. 💡  The screenshots are from the iOS version of the app. While the Android version may have slight design differences, the functionality remains the same. ⚠️ The shift will remain yours in all three scenarios until a colleague accepts your request and a manager approves it. Shifts with a request that is awaiting approval will display a Pending icon. You can always cancel the exchange before the other party acts on it or a manager approves it.   Still have questions?

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated yesterday Table of contents 🎯  This article is for employees using the Planday app or the web to request time off. Are you an admin? See  How to request leave on behalf of an employee. Please note that the screenshots may vary slightly between  Android  and  iOS , but the process remains similar. Make sure to use the latest version of Planday app, and update to newer versions as they are released. In Planday, leave from work requests are supported if your manager or admin has set up an absence account for you. Different leave rules for requesting leave from work will apply depending on your company and country. Planday makes it easy for you to see available balances and request time off from the app. Please note:  Requesting leave is not the same as reporting unavailable. If you want to signal to your manager that you prefer to be assigned to shifts on certain days or not, use the  Set availability  function to indicate your wishes. How to request leave from the Planday app To make a leave request from the Planday app, press  More , then  Time off  for an overview of your Absence account balance.  Press  Request  (or  +  on Android) at the top right to create a new leave request.  Press the first and last date of your leave period and press  Next  (or  ✔  on Android) in the top right corner to go to the next step. If you have multiple Absence accounts, you can choose which account you want to use for this request after selecting a period. Once the period is selected, you can see an overview of your request, add a comment if you want, and see the balance of each day in your request. Press  Send  (or  ✔  on Android) from the top right corner to submit your request. Your recently sent request will appear under  Pending requests  until a manager takes action to approve or deny the request.   Your manager will receive your request to be off and can approve or reject the request. You can always check your existing requests on the  Time off  screen or cancel a pending request if you feel you no longer need the off.     How to request leave from Planday on the web You can also make leave requests by logging into Planday from a web browser and going to  Home  &gt;  Your leave overview  &gt;  Requests.  Press  Request leave  and follow the two-step process to request a leave.  You can request half-day leave by inputting  0.5  as the day's value. (The option to request half-day leave is available only via the web platform and not the app)   To see the status of your past or current leave requests, switch to the  Requests  tab from  Home  &gt;  Your leave overview  &gt;  Requests  page.   FAQs and troubleshooting I am unable to apply for leave Possible reasons: Make sure you have an active absence account assigned. Without it, you won't be able to request leave. If unsure, contact your manager. Check if there's another request overlapping in future. Pay attention to the validity period of your absence account. Requests outside this period won't succeed. Avoid entering &quot;0&quot; (zero) days in the absence request. To remove a leave day within a period, submit two separate leave requests.  How do I cancel a leave request? Cancelling a pending request  — In the Planday app, go to  More  &gt;  Time off  and find your pending request. Hit the X symbol, then  Delete .

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For advanced admins. See  How to configure revenue in Planday. Additional payroll costs are used to get a realistic overview of your actual employment costs by factoring in payroll elements that can add to the total scheduled cost of an employee.   As an example, additional payroll costs can be used to forecast superannuation costs (through an additional payroll cost of 10 %).   To get started, go to  Settings  &gt;  Reports  &gt;  Revenue  and then  Additional payroll costs . Click  Create  and you can start to set up an additional payroll cost, as a percentage.   There are a few more details that you can configure: Title:  Name the additional payroll cost, so you can find it later if needed. Additional payroll costs:  Add in the percentage you would like to inflate the rate by (the percentage you'd like to simulate the costs with). Wage type:  Choose which method of payment you would like to inflate. This can be Schedule costs, such as hourly rates (hourly wage), Shift rates (wage per shift), or salaries (fixed salary). Employee type:  Choose a specific employee type that this rule will affect.  By default, the additional payroll cost will apply to  All  employee types.  💡 If you need to change that, you'll have to save your changes first and then reopen the payroll cost details page, from the ✏️ icon, to edit it. Description : Optionally, you can write a note to describe the additional cost. Example: Application of the additional payroll costs on the schedule Additional payroll costs will affect both the costs on the schedule and the revenue report. Please keep in mind that as this addition only takes place for scheduled costs (as a simulation), these rules will not change the payroll costs. This can be useful when checking the Revenue bar on the Schedule page. Here is the Revenue bar, with both revenue and payroll costs displayed, before adding a simple 10% additional payroll cost: And here is the same bar, with the 10% rule attached: As you can see, by adding the additional cost, a schedule that looks under budget would come in over budget when the scheduled costs more accurately represent the actual cost of employment.

Choose from the  Excel data field  dropdown list the field you need to create. This will show all the information you can bring into your payroll report.   In this example, an Email address field needs to be added to the payroll export file.   Any Data field marked with a person icon will contain personal data from the employee profile, while the other type will be scheduling data (marked with a board-like icon). This allows you to create a comprehensive payroll report with both employee and schedule data.   Select the  data   field  you need, give it a  name  (so you can easily find it later), and type the  sort order   number  (a small number would be displayed before a larger one, in the report).   Press  Save  and your new field should appear in the Prints list and on your Excel payroll report from the next export.

          <attvalue for="2" value="Table of contents All Collections Payroll &amp; Revenue  Payroll supplements Payroll supplements Set predetermined supplements to pay employees for overtime and set payment rules if they go over their contracted hours. Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 This article is intended for users who haven't imported an award via our Award library. You can navigate to  Australian awards  if you have imported an award via our Award library.   You can create payroll supplements to make automatic adjustments to employees’ hourly rates or salaries based on set criteria. For example, you may want to pay your employees overtime, if they are at work for more than 10 hours during the day by using a normal supplement. Or based on their contract type some employees should be allocated a percentage of their hourly rate if they work on the weekends.   If you are unsure about the supplements that apply to your employees we recommend that you contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman , visit the  Fair Work Commission website  or seek professional legal advice should you require assistance with the necessary calculations or interpretation of the relevant clauses. How to create a Payroll supplement First, go to  Settings  &gt;  Payroll  &gt;  Payroll supplement.   Press the  Create  button under Payroll supplement. Several options will be available from the drop-down menu:   Supplement type : Normal supplements, Week-based supplement, Day-based supplements and Contract rules supplement. Create in Xero as:  Note:  this field is only shown if you have an active integration to Xero which supports the supplement types Normal, Day and Contract rules. Here you can choose to create the supplement as an earnings rate in Xero immediately or leave it to do a  manual sync  later in the integrations settings by following  Xero integration set-up: Step 2:  Sync payroll data . To create them in Xero immediately, choose either  Ordinary Time  or  Overtime.  Ordinary Time is for all your supplements that are not connected to overtime, such as penalty rates. Contract rule:  Option applicable when selecting  Contract rules supplement . Select which Contract rule should the supplement be applicable to. Title : Name of the supplement. Description : Include a description of the supplement. (optional) Hourly wage :  %  will mean the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual: $  (monetary)  will add a set monetary amount to supplemented hours. % (overtime)  is used to create time supplements, that will add worked time to an overtime account, as well as extra hours based on overtime.   Note:   If   $ (monetary)  is selected, a new field will display underneath titled  Rounding method  which will allow you to select one of the following settings: No rounding:  will pay the supplement amount for the exact time worked Round up to the nearest hour:  will pay the supplement for every part of an hour started Start type : 1. Hour:  The supplement is controlled from a start and end time. 2. Relative to Shift:  this option will allow you to start the supplement after a certain number of minutes into the shift. 2.a. Applies after: by choosing the value ‘240’ the supplement starts after the employee’s shift has lasted 240 mins. 2.b. Duration: it refers to how long the supplement should last in minutes. If you want the supplement to apply to the entire shift beyond the 4 hours, please set the duration to e.g. 1200 minutes. Payment period : This is relative to the chosen supplement. See the descriptions below and further examples.   Weekdays : Select what days of the week the supplement should be applicable.   Days from Public Holiday calendar : You can choose the  Calendar assigned to employee  option or a specific calendar so that the system will pick the right days on which to apply the supplement.   Valid from/to : When does the supplement come into effect or end.   Partially valid range:  Option available when selecting a week-based supplement.   Employee groups : Select which Employee groups are eligible for the supplement.   Employee types : Select which Employee types are eligible for the supplement.   Shift types:  Select which shift types are eligible for the supplement.   Affects salaried employees : If selected, the supplement will also affect those with a fixed salary rather than an hourly rate.   Affected by breaks : If there is a break in the shift, should the break affect the shift time and therefore the total amount of time being affected by the supplement.   Enforced payment : Enable this to ensure that the supplement is always added to the pay – even though other supplements are present in the same period of the shift. Note:  When enabling this option, it’s important to proceed with caution and consider the potential impact on the payout of other supplements that may apply to the same shift. As enabling this option may obstruct the inclusion of those other supplements when they may need to be included as an addition rather than be overwritten. Allow over midnight : Select if a shift goes over midnight, potentially into a day not selected as being covered by a supplement, should the supplement continue to apply on the hours that fall in the next day after midnight. Supplements by shift type Supplements can be set up to trigger payment based on the use of shift types for scenarios where overtime, penalties and loadings are required. When particular shifts in the schedule are labelled using shift types, there is a clear definition of when an employee is scheduled to work ordinary hours, is on leave (Annual leave, Compassionate leave, etc.), or is scheduled to work overtime.   The following supplement types cater for shift types: Normal Day-based Week-based   To see which shift types trigger supplements for overtime, penalties and loading in relation to an award enabled in Planday, navigate to one of the award articles located in the  Australian awards  collection.   Normal supplement Normal supplements are used when an employee’s pay rate should be adjusted at a certain time of the day, or after a specified amount of hours into a shift. You can set the increase or decrease in pay rate based on a percentage of a wage or as a set monetary value.   Shown below is an example of a Normal supplement for an Employee group named  Chefs . After 8.5 hours  Chefs  should be paid an additional 50% of their normal wage, but only up to a maximum of 3 hours.    Note:  if you create a supplement that has a fixed start and should cover shifts that cross over midnight, you should be aware that it might be added early in the day as well. For example, if you create a supplement rule to be applied from 00:00 to 06:00 and your working days are set from Monday to Friday, you should be aware that the supplement will be applied early Monday (between 00:00-06:00). Day-based supplement Day-based supplements are used when employees work more than one shift per day. The day-based supplement will account for all hours worked during the day.   The first payment period refers to the time of the day when the supplement is active. Set this to 00:00-00:00 if you want the supplement to apply throughout the day. The second payment period defines the threshold after which the supplement kicks in and the maximum application of it.   Shown below is an example of a Day-based supplement to be applied to days in which the employee works more than 9.00 hours between 8:00 and 21:00. A limit of 24 hours applies to this supplement.     Week-based supplement Week-based supplements are used to apply a supplement after a set number of hours worked in a week.   Note: this supplement should only be used if you are not using the Contract rules and thereby can’t use the Contract rules supplement. This supplement does not transfer to Xero.   The first payment period refers to the time of the day when the supplement is active. The second payment period defines the threshold after which the supplement kicks in and the maximum application of it.     Shown below is an example of a week-based supplement that will apply an additional 50% of an employee’s normal wage after 40 hours have been worked in a single week. This supplement should count hours worked between 08:00 and 21:00, and have a cap of 58 hours, allowing for a total of 18 hours in which this supplement can be active in a single week.       Contract rules supplement A Contract rules supplement can be applied to all employees that have a specific contract rule to pay them automatically for any overtime supplements. For this type of supplement to work, you should already have  contract rules set up  for different employee types under  Settings  &gt;  Contract rules  &gt;  Create Contract rule.  This governs how many hours an employee should be working and lets you see and compare if they go beyond the contracted hours in the schedule and pay them a supplement.       Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For experienced admins.  Assign a salary to your employees  first. Enable payroll costs in the schedule You can view the payroll hours and costs of your salaried and waged employees in the schedule to help you to plan your shifts effectively.    💡  You must activate the settings for payroll costs to appear on the schedule by going to  Schedule  &gt;  View settings  &gt; and activating  Payroll hours &amp; costs.   If you pay employees a fixed salary instead of wages, you have various options for calculating the salary costs in the schedule. In this article, you will learn about those calculation methods and can decide which method to use.   To assign a fixed salary to an employee, see the article  How to set an employee's salary . Select an employee &gt;  Edit  &gt;  Employment  &gt;  Fixed Salary  &gt;  Edit salary . In the top section of the edit window - Payroll information - you should see the data entered for your employee's salary:   If salary data has been added, go to the next section  Payroll costs in Schedule.   💡 Remember that the cost allocation and payroll are different. Salary will be reflected in the payroll as a set amount regardless of how you allocate the cost in the schedule.    Calculate payroll costs based on Salary amount In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  &gt; and then select  Salary amount .   You can see a direct calculation of this in the lower section, Estimated costs per hour. Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary amount is divided by the number of shift hours in the schedule for the current salary period. When entered in the rota, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works that day.   Example: An employee is paid a fixed salary of $2000. The estimated cost per hour - $26.67 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of shift hours in the schedule - in this case, 75. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift in the schedule is given as $160.02 (6 * $26.67). 💡  The  Payroll start day  is the day of the month from which each salary calculation will begin. This value can't be set as a higher number because the month of February has 28 days (with the exception of leap years).   Calculate payroll costs based on Scheduled hours In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  &gt; and then select  Scheduled hours .   You can see a direct calculation in the lower section  Estimated hourly cost . Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary is divided by the expected working hours in the Schedule. When entered in the schedule, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works on that day. The total cost may therefore differ from the fixed salary, depending on how many hours are assigned to the employee. The actual salary cost will not change for Payroll even if the cost on the Schedule is higher/lower.   Example: An employee receives a fixed salary sum of $2.000 and is supposed to work 60 hours per month according to their contract. The estimated cost per hour - $33.33 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the expected hours worked. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift is indicated in the schedule as 200.00$ (6 * $33.33). Calculate payroll costs based on Business days In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Bussiness days . For  Business days , select the days of the week to be included in the calculation.  For  Show in Schedule for , select the department in which to display the salary costs. In the lower area,  Estimated daily cost , you can see a direct calculation. Optional: You can change the day of the month from which the salary is calculated at  Show cost calculation each month, starting from . Confirm your selection by pressing  Save . The estimated daily cost is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of opening days in the  Pay period  (by default: Monthly). The estimated daily cost may vary from month to month, depending on the business days in the period.   Don’t show (default) By default, the option  Don't show  is set. This means that the fixed salary is not taken into account when calculating the total payroll costs on the schedule. However, it remains added for the Payroll export data.   Need more help?

Besides the default  Monthly  option, Employees may prefer to be paid more frequently on a  weekly  or  fortnightly  schedule giving them quick budgeting possibilities. However, it can be time-consuming to have to run payroll at a more frequent interval if you have many employees.   You have the following options to choose from when setting a Pay period: Monthly  - (default) - Employees get their hourly salary calculated for the month or earn a fixed income. This option is suitable for fixed-salaried employees. Fortnightly  - also known as  bi-weekly  or  every other week pay period . Employees get their hourly salary calculated for two weeks. This option is suitable for hourly paid employees. Weekly  - You can use this to pay your hourly or fixed-salaried employees on a weekly basis. Four-weekly  - You can choose this option if you pay your employees after four weeks (as opposed to every calendar month). This option is suitable for hourly paid employees. How to set or change an employee’s pay period? While choosing a pay period when starting a new business may be easy, changing to a new period for existing employees can also be accomplished very quickly. You can change an employee’s pay period by navigating to  People  &gt;  Employees  &gt; click the name of the employee and press  Edit  &gt; go to  Employment  tab &gt; scroll down to the  Pay period  section. 💡 When changing a pay period, you must specify when that Pay period should come into effect.

These steps are relevant if you haven’t enabled any of the supported awards from the Award library. We recommend that you create a Public holiday calendar relevant for your business or employees before proceeding. Navigate  here  to learn more.    Furthermore, it is advisable to ensure that departments and employee groups are set up accordingly to your business before initiating the set-up in this article.  See  Understanding the structure of Planday  to learn more.    If you’re unsure of what employment terms are relevant to your business or your employees, we encourage you to visit the  Fair Work Commission Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. You may also wish to seek independent legal advice as may be appropriate for your business. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly.    1. Employee types Employee types are used to define the employees’ type of employment i.e. full-time, part-time or casual.

Navigate to  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Breaks  to create the relevant break rules for your business. On the left-hand side of the create form, you can define  who this break should apply  for based on I.e. employee type.

Working time rules Working time rules are used to set guidelines for how to schedule your employees. For example, you can create a rule on the maximum number of hours an employee can work. If a shift longer than the maximum is created, you will be prompted a warning in the schedule.   Navigate to  Settings &gt; Schedule &gt; Working time rules  to create working time rules relevant for your business.     4. Automating Penalty rates using Payroll supplements  Navigate to  Settings &gt; Payroll &gt; Payroll supplement  to set up penalty rates applicable for your employees.    These rates will apply automatically based on the parameters input when creating the payroll supplement. Learn more about the different types of supplements  here .

Make sure you're at the right location When using the Punch Clock with the Planday app on your smartphone,  GPS or Location services must be switched On . Your employer can set the Punch Clock so that you have to be within a certain radius of your workplace to use the Punch Clock. If you are outside your workplace or at the wrong location, go back and try again.   Ensure that you're connected to the correct company Wi-Fi Your employer can optionally restrict the use of the Punch Clock to a Wi-Fi network of their choice. In this case, you can clock in  only if your device is on an approved Wi-Fi network , not on another one or mobile data. If necessary, open your Wi-Fi settings to check that you are connected to a company Wi-Fi with good signal strength.    Turn on Wi-Fi, Location services, and Mobile Data As outlined in the previous steps, Punch Clock may be restricted by location or Wi-Fi network. A good signal strength when using mobile data is usually sufficient if there are no restrictions. You can ensure that Wi-Fi and mobile data are activated in your mobile device settings.

Feel free to contact your manager directly to learn more about how Punch Clock is setup at your facility. If using an Android device, ensure location services are enabled by swiping down from the top or navigating to Location from the Settings panel. Turn on the feature there and set options to improve accuracy if necessary. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Android device. If you have any questions or problems, please get in touch with Android support. If you've followed the steps above and still have trouble with location services, you can check the maps app to see if your position is accurate enough. If you have problems, talk to your manager to check whether the punch radius is too small for the Punch Clock to be functional. Restart the Planday app and your device In some cases, fully closing the Planday application and restarting it can resolve Punch Clock issues. You can also try restarting your mobile device. Uninstall and reinstall the Planday app If you experience repeated problems using the app, it may help to uninstall completely and  reinstall it again . Make sure the time is set correctly on the device The device used for clocking in and clocking out should be set to the correct time.

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Planday Admins looking to use time management features. Punch Clock allows staff to clock in for their shifts through the Planday app, via web browser or the designated Kiosk app for iPad. Set up Punch Clock to improve accuracy in time tracking of worked hours.   Please note  that we currently do not support UTC+8:45 (ACWTS) and UTC+10:30 (LHST). If you have any questions or need to change the timezone on your Planday, reach out to our Support Team. Set up web-based Punch Clock by registering your IP address with Planday For employees to clock in and out through  PunchClock.Planday.com  an administrator needs to register the IP address of the network used to access Punch Clock from the workplace: Go to  Settings  &gt;  Punch Clock  &gt;  Employee access , and click the  Add  button under Web access. You will see your current IP address, and if you're on the same network your employees will use to clock in and out, this is the address you will add. Add the IP address. Enter a name, e.g. the location employees will clock in and out. Click  Save .   Don't see the IP address? If you do not see the Current IP address listed on the page and do not know it, it is possible to look it up. If you are physically present at the location on a computer where the Punch Clock needs to work, you can register the IP address by searching for  &quot;what is my IP address&quot; on Google search . Your public IP address will be the first result that appears.   After the IP address is registered, your employees can clock in and out using  PunchClock.Planday.com   By toggling on  “Punch Clock allowed from the workplace Wi-Fi (IP-address(es) must be defined) ” your employees will be able to punch in using the app when their mobile device is connected to the network.   What do I do if the IP address isn't recognised? If you can't access  PunchClock.Planday.com , it is most likely due to a change in your dynamic IP address. Your Internet Service Provider will sometimes change your dynamic IP address. You can add the new IP address by following the steps above when connected to the internet access point used at the workplace.   Set up location-based Punch Clock to punch in or out from the Planday app If you want your employees to punch in by using the Planday app you will have to set up geofencing in Punch Clock settings. Go to  Settings  &gt;  Punch Clock  &gt;  Employee access .

Select the Add new location button: Search for the address of your location in the search field at the top of the map. You can also click and drag to navigate to where you want. Add the Planday departments you want to give access to from this location. Give the GPS zone a name, and select Save. You can adjust the radius when adding a zone.  We recommend a  radius of 100m   or more , as in some cases a smaller area can be affected by phone GPS accuracy, and GPS disturbances in the area thus affecting whether the employees will be able to punch in. If your employees are using iOS devices with software version iOS 14 or later they will need to enable Precise location access for the Planday App to be able to punch in.   Give employees unrestricted access to clocking in and out If you want to give access to Punch Clock from the mobile app without any restrictions, check the box named Punch Clock allowed everywhere under Mobile App Access.

Please note:  Any penalties payable to employees relating to missing meal breaks are not automated in Planday, and you will have to manually adjust the shifts for the appropriate penalty to apply. Automatic breaks Set up automatic break rules to automatically apply breaks either at a specific time of day or after a set amount of time has been worked.   For both  Time of day  and  Time after start  breaks, you can determine: How long a shift must be before an employee receives a break. The days it applies to. If the break should be paid or unpaid. The Department(s) and Employee group(s) the break applies to.   Setting up automatic breaks based on time of the day First, go to  Settings  &gt;  Schedule  &gt;  Break rules  and press  Add break .   To add a break at a specific time of day, press  Add break , and select the  Time of day  break type. Give your break a name, set how long the shift must be for this break to be applicable and set when the break should start and end.     Setting up automatic breaks based on time after start of a shift If you need to give employees a break after they've worked a certain amount of time, go to  Settings  &gt;  Schedule  &gt;  Break rules , press  Add break , then choose the  Time after start  break rule. Specify the break length, then choose how far into the shift the break should begin and if it should be paid or unpaid.     Setting up multiple automatic breaks If you want to set up multiple break rules that occur throughout the day, we recommend that you have the longest shift possible in mind and add all the breaks accordingly.  Follow the steps described above to create your first break rule of the day For the following break(s), add only the additional break time and not the total break time. The breaks will accumulate.  For example, if you want to give your employees one 10 minute paid break if the shift is 4 hours and another 10 minute paid break if the shift is 7 hours, configure this as two separate break rules:   Break rule 1:     Break rule 2:     This will result in 2 x 10 min paid breaks, a total of 20 minutes if the shift is 7 hours or longer.

If you haven’t set your employees with Contract rules, please see this article on  setting up your employees with awards  and apply a Contract rule to an employee. Suppose you have applied a Contract rule to an employee via an award or created one yourself. In that case, you can administer the rule's application to an employee and make more informed schedules. For example, you can see which employees have the hours they need, which are under-scheduled and which have been overscheduled.   Scheduled hours and overtime in the schedule A traffic light system is used to keep track of your employee's ordinary hours of work in relation to their contracted or agreed number of hours per week. You can then identify overtime or undertime when scheduling.   As you schedule shifts for employees, a coloured ring around their profile picture indicates their compliance with the rule. You can see these rules when you switch to the employee view on the schedule.  No outline: No Contract rule has been assigned to the employee. 🟡 Yellow outline = The employee has been scheduled to work too few hours, and there is no overtime. 🟢 Green outline = Employee has been scheduled to work the correct number of ordinary hours and has no overtime.  🔴 Red outline = The employee has been scheduled overtime hours. How to see a summary of hours per employee On the  Schedule  page, please switch to the  Employees  view and click on an employee's avatar or initials with a traffic light circle to open a summary of their worked hours.    Here you can see a summary of hours that count towards determining overtime. The columns show the following aspects for calculation: Valid from  and  Valid to -  Start and end of your interval period. Interval type  - Type of the interval set up in Contract rule. Scheduled hours  - Show all the hours the employee has been scheduled to work. This includes ordinary hours  plus  overtime hours. Ordinary hours  - Shows scheduled hours  minus  all of the overtime hours. Contracted hours  - These are the employee's Regular hours of work (ex. weekly interval 30hrs) Deviation  - This shows the difference between ordinary hours and contracted hours. 🟡 Yellow if contracted hours are not met. 🟢 Green if scheduled according to contracted hours.  Overtime  - Shows overtime hours as soon as any of the rules in the Contract rule trigger overtime. 🔴 Red if overtime applies.   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and Schedule Managers. Setup Punch Clock  to make full use of this feature. What are Punch Clock rounding rules? In Planday, you can enable rounding rules for the Punch Clock. Rounding, in this case, means rounding up or down the actual time your employees clocked in or clocked out to a &quot;round&quot; time - such as 9:00 instead of 08:56.   For example, an employee has a planned shift from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, shows up before the shift starts and punches in at 8:56 am for work. If a corresponding rounding rule is activated, the system automatically suggests the employee's start time as 9:00 - so it would be rounded up. Before approving shifts, you will always have the opportunity to change the times - active rounding rules only help you with suggestions which are not final. You can adapt the rounding rules according to the usual practices in your company.   Prior to setting up Rounding Rules in Planday, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business. 💡  Please note that the Rounding rules can only be used in combination with the Punch Clock. You can learn more about  Setting up your Punch Clock . Configure the basics of rounding settings Rounding settings make approval of time sheets faster and more accurate. It is especially useful for cases where the scheduled hours aren't necessarily what will be approved for payroll.   For example, if employees are required to clock in or out within 10 minutes of their shift, the Rounding settings can be set up to reflect that. You can also combine multiple Rounding settings to create a more robust set of suggestions. You can access rounding settings via  Settings  &gt;  Punch Clock  &gt;  Advanced  &gt;  Rounding settings .    There are two different rounding rules that you can set: Common rules  - Set common rules for how Punch Clock entries change when employees punch in or out earlier or later than their Shift times. Custom rules  - Custom rules replace common rules and allow you to set advance rule settings, allowing you to limit them by Departments, Employee groups, or Employee types.  How to set up common rounding rules Common rounding rules define how punch times are rounded if employees punch in or out earlier or later than their scheduled time. Below are some settings you can set as  Common rules :   For both the Start and End times, you can choose from the following rounding methods. No rounding, show punch time  - By default, Planday will show the employees' punched times both for the start and end time and pay them by the minute. No rounding, show shift time  - If your employees usually get paid based on their scheduled hours, you can change the settings to  No rounding, show shift time . Round down  - This option would round down to the nearest 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 or 60 minutes of the punch time. This option is useful if you always trim down the punch time to the nearest round value. Round up  - This option would round up to the nearest 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 or 60 minutes of the punch time. This option is useful if you are always trimming up the punch time to the nearest round value. The basic settings are for Start and End times, but to build a more robust set of rules, you can create  Custom rules  giving you more control over the rounding behaviour and limiting the application to specific employees.  💡  Please note that if you have set Custom rounding rules, they will take priority over the Common rules. How to set up custom rounding rules If you create  Custom rules , these rules will override your Common rounding rules. The Custom rules can be combined with filtering on other variables, such as Departments and Employee groups, as well as being set to apply for a set number of minutes starting from scheduled times.   Press  Create , and after you give the rule a  name .  Type  - You can then choose between the following rule types: Punched in : Clock-ins, with no regard to scheduled times  Punched out : Clock-outs, with no regard to scheduled times Punched in early : Clock-ins, registered before the scheduled start time Punched in late : Clock-ins, registered after the scheduled start time Punched out early : Clock-outs, registered before the scheduled end time Punched out late : Clock-outs, registered after the scheduled end time Rounding method  - Choose what you want to happen to the times affected by the rule. No rounding: This shows the time the employee clocked in or out Round down: Rounds down to the nearest 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes Round up: Rounds up to the nearest 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes Round to nearest: Rounds up or down to the nearest 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes No rounding, show shift time: Shows the originally scheduled time No rounding, show punch time: Shows the actual time the employee clocked out If you have chosen one of the options such as rounding up, down, or to the nearest, you can set the number of minutes before moving on to Targets and types.   Targets and types -  Depending on the setup of your Planday account, you can choose between the following to limit the application of the custom rounding rule: Departments  - Apply the rule to specific Departments only. Employee groups  - Apply the rule only to specific Employee groups Employee types  - Apply the rule only to specific Employee types Press  Save  when done.   Encourage employees to leave comments when clocking in and out When employees clock in and out, they have the option to leave a comment. This comment is visible to the Schedule managers on the shift and during  timesheet approval . We recommend managers encourage their employees to leave comments when arriving early or late, as well as when clocking out before or after the shift ends.   The combination of Rounding settings and comments makes it faster to approve hours for payroll. In addition, managers can save themselves from following up on employees when they deviate from their scheduled hours by stating the reason.    View the clocked-in hours affected by rounding rules   ⬆️ After adding some rounding rules, when you go to approve the clocked-in shift hours under  Timesheets  (1), click on one of the entries to approve (2) and you can see:  The scheduled time and the punch time (3) The time to approve (4). If you’ve set up rounding rules, Planday will take these into account. You can always edit this time before you click on the  Approve  button. Learn more about Timesheets in  How to manage and approve Timesheets in Planday .   Example of a common Punch Clock rounding setup Here, we'll show you an example of a setup that is popular with many Planday customers. The basic idea is that when employees clock in or out within a few minutes of their scheduled time, Planday will suggest the scheduled shift time for approval. When the difference between the scheduled time and clocked time exceeds a set number of minutes, Planday will suggest the punched-in time for approval instead. Depending on comments or company policy, the manager can always edit what times to include for payroll.   Scenario When employees clock in or out within 5 minutes before or after the scheduled time, Planday will suggest the scheduled shift’s time instead of their clocked time. When employees clock in or out outside of 5 minutes before or after their scheduled shift, Planday will suggest the clocked time instead. Start and End times will be flagged for review. Setup Go to  Settings  &gt;  Punch Clock  &gt;  Advanced . Check that the dropdowns for Start and End are set to  No rounding, show punch time  under  Common rules .    These are the fallback settings for cases outside the rules you are going to set up under  Custom rules .    Next, press the  Create  button under  Custom rules .    Set a rule for when the employees  clock in before their shift starts: Give the rule a name Select  Punched in early Set the Rounding method to  No rounding, show shift time Max deviation duration decides for how many minutes before a shift starts the Punch Clock entry will be rounded up to the scheduled start time. In this example, we set  5  minutes. Scroll down to make changes to  Targets and types  if needed. Press  Save Lastly, a rule for when employees  clock out after their shift ends : Click Create and give the rule a name Select  Punched out late Set the Rounding method to  No rounding, show shift time Max deviation duration decides for how many minutes after a shift ends the Punch Clock entry will be rounded down to the scheduled end time. In this example, we set 5 minutes. Scroll down to make changes to Targets and types if needed Click  Save 💡  Changing the number of minutes a rule is applied is an effective way to make further adjustments. If employees are usually paid from the start time of their shift, then it makes sense to increase the number of minutes under Max deviation duration for when employees clock in early.

How do I change a paid break to unpaid and vice versa?  If you want to convert to a paid break, go to the Schedule and edit the relevant shift. Click on the pencil icon next to the Breaks section and change the break from Unpaid to Paid.   Can I use both paid and unpaid breaks on the same shift? Yes, you can combine paid and unpaid breaks on shifts either by setting up break rules or adding them manually to the shifts.    Can my business use Punch Clock Breaks? Yes, if your business is using Punch Clock, you can enable your employees to clock in and out of their shifts for breaks using the Punch Clock Break feature. To read a guide on how to set this up,  click here. Note that by default, breaks in the Punch Clock are unpaid but can  manually be changed to paid . What happens if I have added a manual break to a shift but also use Punch Clock breaks? A manually entered break will always remain on the shift as long as the Punch Clock Break does not overlap with the manual break.   What happens if I have set up automatic break rules but also use Punch Clock Breaks? Automatic breaks applied via Break rules will be overwritten, when Punch Clock Breaks also are enabled for the same department.   In the schedule, the automatic break will disappear from the shift as soon as an administrator has approved the Punch Clock entry. This is the case whether or not the employee has punched in and out. Please note  that overriding the breaks required for your employee could be in breach of your compliance obligations. You should seek independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.       What will the employee see from the app in terms of breaks? The shift details timeline displays the start and end times of the shift and the breaks during the shift. If a break is at a specific time of the day, the employee will see the start and end times of the break. If the break occurs after a certain amount of time within the shift, the employee will see: the break's start time, which is calculated automatically against the scheduled start time of the shift the length of the break, counted in minutes In the example below, the employee starts at 9:00 am and finishes at 5:00 pm. The break begins after 4 hours of work (1:00 pm) and lasts 30 minutes.   FAQs regarding Break rules How does changing a Break rule impact existing approved or non-approved breaks on the schedule? Only shifts created or edited after the change will adopt the new/updated Break rule. This means that the breaks you have approved in the system will not be affected and will preserve the settings before the rule change. Any new breaks with the attached Break rule will include the changes. Similarly, only future breaks are impacted when changes to breaks happen via the application of  Shift types  or  Employee types . How can you update past and existing shifts on the schedule to reflect the revised break rule changes? Any past or existing shifts on the schedule affected by a change to a Break rule will not automatically reflect the changes to those shifts.    Here are two simple workarounds you can try: Apply a Schedule template: If you want to apply a new or revised break rule to a specific period, you can apply a template to that period. This will help you implement the desired break rule. Edit and bulk change shift types: Another option is to edit the shift type for a selected number of shifts. After editing, you can bulk change them back to the original shift type. This allows you to make changes to the shift types as needed. How can shifts in a Schedule template be updated to reflect the changes made to Break rules? When you update Break rules, the shifts in the Schedule template adjust to reflect those changes. Here's how it works: Applying a template:  When you apply a template to the schedule, all shifts in the template will be checked against the updated Break rules. Any necessary adjustments will be made to the shifts based on the new rules. Copying a week:  If you copy a week from an existing schedule, the shifts in the copied week will be checked against the Break rules. Any changes made to the rules will be applied to those shifts accordingly. Saving a schedule as a template:  When you save a schedule as a template, any automatic breaks defined by the rules will not be carried over. Only manual breaks will be included in the template.

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For administrators. Read more about each access level and which security each right has in  Overview of Access levels . What are Access levels Employees can be assigned extra  Access levels  in Planday, each granting different privileges. This feature may be helpful when you add managerial staff such as Schedule managers, HR managers, and additional administrators to your Planday setup or promote a staff member with more responsibilities.   It is possible to limit Access levels per Department. This means that an employee with Schedule Manager access can be limited to managing or modifying only the Schedule belonging to their Department.     How to give additional access to an employee To add or remove additional access for an employee, you can follow these steps: Go to  People  &gt;  Employees  to view all employees. Use the search function or scroll to find the employee whose permissions you wish to update. Click on their name to open their details, or press the  Edit  button and switch to the  Advanced settings  tab   &gt;  Access levels. Under the  Access levels  section, press  Add  to assign additional permissions to the employee.   Alternatively, you can also assign access levels from the full edit view in the new  Advanced settings  tab, as shown below:   Note that the option to  Include future departments  becomes available when you select all Departments. This means that this employee will be given the chosen Access level on any new departments you create. For example, you can set this so that your HR manager can always access any future Departments you create. Limit Access level by Department You can limit the Access level of admins or managers to only the Departments they manage. For example, you can have two Schedule managers who each have access only to the  Department  they manage and limit them from supervising other Departments. To adjust these settings, follow the steps below: Go to  People  and then  Employees  to view all employees. Click on the  name of the employee  whose access should be limited the same way you would add a new permission. Under the  Access level  field, edit the Access level you wish to limit. Under the  Departments  section, you can choose  All departments  or the ones you want them to manage.  This can also be done when assigning new Access levels. Press  Save  to apply your changes.   FAQs  Why can’t I see the payroll information and the documents tab of some employees that I edit? This is most likely because these employees have the same Access levels as you do. Managers with the same access level can’t see nor edit each other’s payroll information or access each others' documents. I’m an admin. Why can’t I see the list of deactivated employees under  People  &gt;  Employees ? This is usually because you are restricted to one or several departments. When employees are deactivated, they lose their connection to a department. You can reach out to support if you need further information.   Need more help?

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and HR managers. Deactivate an employee's user account When an employee leaves your company, you can  deactivate  their account to prevent further access to Planday. To deactivate an employee, follow these steps: Go to  People &gt; Employees . Please search for the employee you want to deactivate and  click on their name . Under the employee’s information overview, press the delete icon 🗑 to deactivate the employee. In the deactivate employee prompt that opens, you can either deactivate the employee immediately or set a future automatic deactivation date. You will also need to choose whether to set the employee’s future shifts to open or leave them assigned to the employee if they will work their remaining future assigned shifts in the Schedule. Finally, you can add a confidential note visible only to HR managers and Admins to document the reason for deactivating the employee. 💡  Please note that deactivated employees do not count towards your employee count, and you will not be billed for them.   Deactivating an admin who originally authorised an Integration 💡  Some integrations such as Square or Lightspeed Retail X-Series will stop working if they were authorised by an admin that is being deactivated by another admin.  A modal will pop up to show if any of the qualifying apps are affected. The other admin will have to reauthorise the relevant integration. To re-activate an integration, go to  Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Overview,  find the relevant one in the list and activate it.  Reactivate an employee's user account You can see a list of deactivated employees by going to  People &gt; Employees &gt;  under the  Misc  section on the left look for the  Deactivated  group.   Press the employee's name and there you can find the option to  Reactivate Employee .     Set up notifications for deactivation You can configure a message or SMS notification to be sent to you or your fellow managers when an employee is deactivated from Planday. Go to  Settings &gt; Your organisation &gt; Notifications &gt; Deactivated , then add the required recipients. When selecting  Add  you will be shown a list of all employees. Only managers with access to deactivate other employees (with access level Admin or HR Managers) will be notified of deactivations.     Inactive employee account deletion To delete an employee account, at minimum, that account must have been inactive for 7+ years. Please see the Fair Work Ombudsman’s website on employers’  Record-keeping  obligations for further information on this subject.   If there is agreement from the Planday admin that data can be deleted, then they may contact the Planday support team to request deleting specific employee data permanently, after which it cannot be retrieved. Data related to the account may also be rendered irretrievable. Again, we recommend seeking appropriate advice and information from the Fair Work Ombudsman website before deleting employee information. We also recommend only taking this action when strictly necessary and with due caution, for example, an employee will lose all payroll and HR history.   To request an account deletion, please contact your Planday admin first or the Planday Support team.   Automatically delete deactivated employee accounts Depending on where your business operates, you may have a legal obligation as an employer to permanently delete information on former employees after their employment has ended.   To automatically delete deactivated users from your Planday account, go to  Settings &gt; People &gt; General &gt; Delete deactivated Employees , to turn on the feature and set how many months after deactivation a user should be permanently deleted from your Planday account.

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  This article is intended for users who haven't imported an award via our Award library. You can read the articles on  How to set up your own employment terms  if you're not using an Award. Use Contract rules to compare your employees’ scheduled hours to those they’re contracted for right inside the schedule. Setting these rules allows for better insight into which employees have enough hours, which can be contracted for additional hours, and which ones have exceeded their contract limit.   How to create Contract rules If you are unsure about the rules relevant to your employees in respect to overtime and their hours of work, please refer to the Fair Work Ombudsman or seek professional legal advice as necessary.    To create Contract rules, go to  Settings   &gt;  People   &gt;  Contract rules   &gt;  Create Contract rule.   In Step 1, Name the Contract rule, enter an optional description to help you remember what the contract rule is about, and press  Continue .   In Step 2, If certain  Shift types  should be excluded from the Contract rule, you can deselect them by pressing the  Edit  button on  Shift types . Such Shift types could, for instance, be Shift types that don’t count as Ordinary hours, i.e. Unpaid leave.   The start date set is the day and date from which the scheduled hours are counted. For example, if the start date is set to 1 June with an interval length of 1 week and 40 total hours, we can then expect that 40 hours should be worked from the 1st to the 7th, the 8th to the 14th, and so on. Important : If Monday is the start day of your week in the Schedule, then you should always choose a Monday as the start date in your Contract rule. You can always choose an individual date for each of your employees when you assign the contract rule to them. You can now choose the Interval type, which is either Day, Week, Month or Year. You then put in the appropriate number of hours as they relate to the chosen interval.   If you choose the Month option, you will be asked to choose between  Average  (same number of hours each month) or  Individual months  (input a specific number of hours for each month of the year).   Add additional rules for daily working and maximum hours You have the option to  Add additional rules . This lets you specify daily working hours and set the maximum hours after which overtime should apply.   When setting  Daily working hours , you can set a time interval (i.e. 7am to 7pm)  that applies to all days of the week. If your Daily working hours are not the same each day, such as on the weekends, you can also set them for each individual day of the week.   When setting  Maximum hours per day , you have the same options to either set a particular number of hours to apply to all days of the week or individually set each day's maximum number of ordinary hours. Select the checkbox if values are different for each day.

You have a few options for editing, which are presented in this article. Add a new section Press the  Add section  button to add new sections to your employee form. Adding a new section will allow you to add more fields and keep them in a common area.    How to edit a field or section ⚠️  We ask you to be extra careful when editing existing fields. Changes to an existing field can cause the information to be lost. Click the pencil icon ✏️ on a line to edit the corresponding field or section. You can change the section's name and update settings for names, field types, permissions, and other field settings. The options available when editing a field is similar to those available when creating a field - you will find an overview  further down in this article .

(see screenshot below)   For employees, this field will appear in their profile area by navigating to their name at the top right of their screen and clicking  Edit  in the drop-down list.   How to reorder the sections and fields in the employee form Click  Manage order  and an editing window will appear on the right side of the screen. Here you can set the order of the categories and fields in the employee form.     By clicking  Expand  or  Collapse , you can show or hide the individual fields in the categories.

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For admins.  Find here an  introduction to Planday's structure .  Learn  how to create Employee groups here . Deleting Employee groups You need to consider some essential points before deleting an  Employee group . Employee groups define your Schedules, so deleting an Employee group will impact existing schedules.   Review the following points to prevent any negative impact when deleting an Employee group: Previously created shifts connected to the deleted Employee group will remain visible and will still affect payroll. New shifts cannot be created using the deleted Employee group. Assigned shifts for the deleted Employee group can no longer be swapped. Open shifts for the deleted Employee group cannot be requested or claimed. Assigning employees to different Employee groups after you delete the Employee group can impact payroll if there are inconsistencies between the defined wages of the Employee groups or duplication of shifts. In most cases, we encourage you to reassign shifts and/or create new Employee groups before deleting the Employee group to ensure that your schedule remains dynamic. If you are satisfied that it is safe to delete the Employee group, you can follow these steps: Go to  People  &gt;  Employee Groups . Find the Employee group you want to delete and press the  Edit  icon on the right. From the  Edit employee group  view, press  Delete  and confirm your decision.   Furthermore, if there are any Positions associated with the Employee group in your schedule, you will not be able to delete the Employee group. In this case, you will need to delete the Shifts for that position, delete the Position and then delete the Employee group.   Restoring Employee groups If you have deleted an Employee group but need to recover it, you can do so easily.  Navigate to  People  &gt;  Employee groups  and find the  Restore Employee group  button in the top right corner. This will prompt a new window where you can select which Employee group you'd like to reinstate and whether or not employee memberships should be kept as they were before the deletion.

Access levels in Planday To get a quick overview of the different access levels in Planday go to the menu People. On the left side menu, at the bottom, you will find the list of access levels. Here you can also see how many employees have each access level assigned.    Tip!  You can click on each access level from this page if you want to see which employees the number represents. From here you can also get a quick overview of which department each access level can manage. Lastly, it is also possible to edit the access levels if you need to give more or less access to an employee. There are four different Access levels that you can assign to an employee:   Note:  The levels can be named differently depending on the language selected for your Planday account. It can also be because the names were changed during your onboarding process or by our Support team, upon request from an admin in your business.   Administrator The  Admin  role in Planday has the highest level of access, with full administrative permissions. Admins can view and edit payroll information, manage all schedules, and edit employee details. They can also add or remove administrative permissions from other employees and deactivate accounts. Due to these extensive powers, it is advised to grant Admin permission carefully.   HR Manager In Planday,  HR Managers  can create new employees, edit employee information (except salary), manage contracts, handle holiday requests, generate schedule reports, and more.   Schedule Manager A  Schedule Manage r in Planday can create and edit schedules. They can see payroll costs per day in the Schedule but cannot view or edit payroll details. The role can be limited to specific Departments, preventing managers from editing shifts in other Departments.   Account Admin The Account Admin access level is the default group for those responsible for signing up and setting up Planday for their organisation. This new access level is designed to help decision-makers manage their organisation more efficiently in Planday. It won't affect your existing security groups and access levels. However, please note that the Account Admin access level is for information purposes only and does not grant access to any Planday features. To manage access and data security within your organisation, continue using the three permission levels mentioned above. Please note : Managers with the same access level can’t see nor edit each other’s payroll information or access each others' documents. Comparison of different Access levels in Planday The following table outlines all Access levels per role:   Note:  ⬆️  The attributes described above for each Access level are default ones. They can be changed during the onboarding process or if a full admin in your business requests it. Need more help?   Please search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our  video tutorials .

Information is valuable and sometimes private. That means that sometimes you need to fine-tune which employee details should be visible throughout your organisation.   Visibility of an employee to other employees The visibility of an employee can be enabled or disabled from their details page by going to  People  &gt; select the employee you wish to edit &gt;  Edit  ✎. Here you can switch the  Contact info public  on or off.   When  Contact info public  is disabled, that employee will not be visible in the People list for their colleagues (this applies both to the web platform and the Planday app). On the other hand, you - as a manager, will have access to your employees' contact details independent of this setting.   When  Contact info public  is enabled, at least the  First name  and  Last name  will be visible to everyone. You have full visibility control over all the other fields, including emails, phone numbers, birthdays, nicknames and custom fields.   Control which information should be visible to the employees If the  Contact info public  is enabled and you wish to display additional fields to the employees, you can control this by going to  Settings  &gt;  People  &gt;  Employees.  Here you can select or unselect which fields, other than first name and last name, should be visible to all employees including any customs fields.   💡  Please note that this works slightly differently in the mobile app. Here the employees see the phone number and email address of their colleagues regardless of the selected fields (provided that the field &quot;Contact details is public&quot; is activated for the specific employee.   ⚠️ If  contact info public  is disabled, team members will not be able to see the selected employee in the employee list. However, if this option is enabled, at least the first name and last name are displayed for everyone. You can fully control the visibility of all other fields: email addresses, phone numbers, birthdays, nicknames, and custom fields.   Add custom fields to your employees’ information If you need something specific to be shown for each employee, you can add custom fields by going to  Settings &gt;  People  &gt;  Employee form setup .    Please keep in mind that you can only access this page if you are an Admin or HR manager. In the Employee form, you can edit or create new fields, add or reorder sections and archive the sections you don't need.   See  How to modify the employee form  article to learn more.

To delete a Department, navigate to  People  &gt;  Departments  &gt; press the name of the department that you would like to delete &gt; press  Delete .   When you take this action you will be prompted with a pop-up message asking you to confirm your decision. Press  Delete  again to confirm your choice or press  Cancel  to discontinue.

The Shifts will not be removed, but remain on the individual employees' profiles under the Shifts tab after the department has been deleted.   How to restore a deleted Department You have the option to restore a deleted Department by navigating to  People  &gt;  Departments  &gt; clicking the  Restore Department  button to the left of the Create Department button.

Punch Clock allows staff to clock in for their shifts through the Planday app, via web browser or the designated Kiosk app for iPad. Set up Punch Clock to improve accuracy in time tracking of worked hours.   Please note  that we currently do not support UTC+8:45 (ACWTS) and UTC+10:30 (LHST). If you have any questions or need to change the timezone on your Planday, reach out to our Support Team. Set up web-based Punch Clock by registering your IP address with Planday For employees to clock in and out through  PunchClock.Planday.com  an administrator needs to register the IP address of the network used to access Punch Clock from the workplace: Go to  Settings  &gt;  Punch Clock  &gt;  Employee access , and click the  Add  button under Web access. You will see your current IP address, and if you're on the same network your employees will use to clock in and out, this is the address you will add. Add the IP address. Enter a name, e.g. the location employees will clock in and out. Click  Save .   Don't see the IP address? If you do not see the Current IP address listed on the page and do not know it, it is possible to look it up. If you are physically present at the location on a computer where the Punch Clock needs to work, you can register the IP address by searching for  &quot;what is my IP address&quot; on Google search . Your public IP address will be the first result that appears.   After the IP address is registered, your employees can clock in and out using  PunchClock.Planday.com   By toggling on  “Punch Clock allowed from the workplace Wi-Fi (IP-address(es) must be defined) ” your employees will be able to punch in using the app when their mobile device is connected to the network.   What do I do if the IP address isn't recognised? If you can't access  PunchClock.Planday.com , it is most likely due to a change in your dynamic IP address. Your Internet Service Provider will sometimes change your dynamic IP address. You can add the new IP address by following the steps above when connected to the internet access point used at the workplace.   Set up location-based Punch Clock to punch in or out from the Planday app If you want your employees to punch in by using the Planday app you will have to set up geofencing in Punch Clock settings.

Select the Add new location button: Search for the address of your location in the search field at the top of the map. You can also click and drag to navigate to where you want. Add the Planday departments you want to give access to from this location. Give the GPS zone a name, and select Save. You can adjust the radius when adding a zone.  We recommend a  radius of 100m   or more , as in some cases a smaller area can be affected by phone GPS accuracy, and GPS disturbances in the area thus affecting whether the employees will be able to punch in. If your employees are using iOS devices with software version iOS 14 or later they will need to enable Precise location access for the Planday App to be able to punch in.

A Planday integration to Xero Payroll provides a seamless experience from managing employee scheduling, time tracking and to submitting timesheets through to completing payroll, alongside your accounting tasks.    To answer any questions about billing and subscription for Planday, here are some frequently asked questions to clarify the process of signing up.   Billing and payment: How will you get billed if you purchased Planday through the Xero add-on? Billing for Planday will be handled through Xero. Planday will provide Xero with the number of active user licences, and the billing process will be managed via Xero's platform. Why are you still billed for it if you bought Planday through the Xero add-on but are not using the Xero integration? Regardless of whether you use the integration, you will be billed for using both Planday and Xero independently.

To unsubscribe, you need to access your Xero account and remove both the Xero subscription and Planday add-on from your subscription settings.

To retain Xero while unsubscribing from Planday, you should remove the Planday add-on from Xero.  This action will immediately close your Planday account.  Afterwards, you can contact Planday support or sales for assistance in reactivating your old Planday organisation and selecting a suitable plan.

You can then open your Xero account and remove the Planday add-on from your subscription.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and Schedule managers. Looking for  summer to autumn DST transition ? This article highlights what you need to know to keep your records in Planday accurate if you have scheduled shifts that overlap daylight saving time changes. When does DST start? DST transition for the spring to summer seasons can occur at different dates around the year across the globe. In Australia, the time adjustment usually occurs on the first Sunday of October on the following dates: 1 October 2023 6 October 2024 5 October 2025 When the  DST period begins , the clocks  advance one hour  during the warmer months. Practically, this means that on the date when the DST period begins, the clock will instantly advance by one hour - when the clock strikes 02:00am, it would immediately become 03:00am instead. So, on this date, the hour between 02:00 and 02:59:59  disappears  in any given time zone). Please note that the exact time for the clock adjustment depends on the time zone of your territory, and it can be different from the example given above. This change usually happens during the night to minimise work schedule disruptions. See  Time zones and daylight saving guidance on Australia.gov.au What does this mean for you, and how to make adjustments in Planday The DST practice can have different implications for managing your organisation in Planday. It depends on your policies and the country where you conduct your operations. The following fixes only apply if you have night shift employees working at a time that crosses over a DST change. Planday does not support automatic DST adjustments  for shift duration. If you need to switch to DST, you must check and manually correct the affected shifts on the  Schedule  by  decreasing  the shift duration or adjusting the  Timesheet entries  by removing an hour. Check and  edit the shift duration  for the shifts that overlap with the DST. As the clock changes forward (and one hour will be  removed ), you should ensure that the shift duration remains correct.  For example:  A shift starting at 10:00 pm and ending at 04:00 am should account for six payable hours. If scheduled on a DST start day, it should account for five rather than six hours. For this overlapping shift, you must  manually   decrease the length  to correctly account for the actual worked hours (remove one hour).   Check your payroll data  to ensure no discrepancy or miscalculation in the number of hours worked for the date when daylight saving time changes occurred. If your payroll data depends on approved shifts and, by extension, on the duration of those shifts, making sure that the shift duration is correct should also be enough to correct your payroll data.   Remember to also communicate any changes to your employees to ensure that everyone is on the same page and avoids confusion. Need more help?

Learn how to configure and apply Multi-factor authentication (MFA) in Planday. Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  This feature is only available for customers in Australia. Please contact our support team if your business operates in another country and you want to use this feature. What is Multi-factor authentication? Multi-factor authentication or MFA adds a layer of security to your account and helps prevent unauthorized access. Besides the username and password, you can set additional authentication methods to manage how your employees can receive a verification code when logging into Planday.   By default, you and your employees must use  Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  to log in to Planday if you connect to Xero organisation. Here’s how it works: Step 1  – At login, type in username and password. You will be asked to configure an MFA method. Step 2  – Select your preferred authentication method. Planday offers two options: A)  Option 1:   SMS -  Enter a valid phone number (it doesn't have to be your number in Planday) to receive an SMS with a code. Use the code to verify the account. You will not be charged an SMS fee for MFA use. B)  Option 2: Authenticator app -  Scan the given QR code with an authentication app or manually enter the setup code in your app. Use the 6-digit code generated by the authenticator app to verify the account. Step 3  – Next time you log in, enter the code sent to you by SMS or from your authenticator app to complete the login process.     Remember MFA settings for next login You can select the option to ☑️  Remember me  for 30 days when using MFA.    You will not be asked to use MFA for 30 days if the option is selected. This also applies if you use the same account on multiple devices.   If this option remains unselected, you will be asked to log in with a username, password and authentication code again upon your next login.   Reset MFA for an employee As an admin or HR manager, you can reset the MFA configuration of an employee’s account if an employee faces authentication-related issues logging in or cannot retrieve their code. The employee will have to configure their MFA again the next time they log in to Planday after you have reset their multi-factor authentication.   To do that, navigate to  People  &gt;  Employees  &gt; select the employee &gt;  Edit  &gt;  User Actions  &gt;  Reset multi-factor authentication .   How to enable or disable MFA in Planday Please note:  MFA is enabled by default and is mandatory if you connect to a Xero organisation. Go to  Settings  &gt;  Security  &gt;  Multi-factor authentication  to configure MFA in Planday.    You can select which authentication methods you'd like enabled in Planday by selecting Enable or Disable to the right of the method ( Authenticator app  or  SMS ).   If you disable a method of MFA in Planday, it will be removed from all employees that have MFA set on their profile. If you have an additional method enabled, the next time your employees log into Planday, they will need to set up MFA again with the remaining method of authentication you have allowed.

Remember to also communicate any changes to your employees to ensure that everyone is on the same page and avoids confusion. Need more help?

If you are unsure of what leave and absence employment terms are correct for your business or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.   If you have set up  leave accounts for your employees , they will be able to request leave for a specific day or period in Planday. Leave requests will show as pending action and you can choose if you, as a manager, would like to be notified further when a request is submitted.   Before you start managing leave requests, make sure you have set up absence leave types To represent absence in Schedule, you first need to select which shift types are eligible to represent absence. Navigate to “ Settings ” and select “ Shift types for leave ”. The mark shift types you would like to use when approving leave requests with a tick.    Overview of leave requests To see an overview of leave requests, go to  Schedule  &gt;  Leave requests  or click on  Leave requests  under  Pending actions  on your  Home dashboard.   The list will show all future  Pending  requests by default. Switch to Approved or All to see the status of other requests.   You can click on the Edit icon or anywhere on the row to see the details of the request.   Adjust the overview filter You can customise the overview of leave requests by using the options in the top bar or adding filters to the overview. This can be useful if you have many requests and you want to focus on some specific requests. Search  - Search for an employee’s name to see their request. Period  - Define a period to see the requests within this span. Status  - Filter requests by status. You can filter the status to see  All  the requests or only  approved, denied,  or  pending  requests. Filters  - Apply filters to see a specific selection of requests.   Approve or deny a leave request To approve or deny a leave request for leave such as unpaid leave, click on the request to see the details.   You can  Deny  the request using the button in the top right.   If you’d like to  Approve  the request, fill out: Daily amount in the ‘Hours’ column Start time for when the scheduled leave / absence shift should start on the day The  account  column lets you adjust which leave account’s balance will be used for the time off and Shift type specified the shift type you will see in Schedule for the given day. Finally, choose a department and employee group for the absence shifts to be created.  If any shifts are assigned to the employee during the requested absence period, you can choose to delete them or keep them. Optionally, you can also create cover shifts as duplicates of the existing shifts which will be set to Open so that they can be assigned to another employee later. Find detailed explanations of various components of a leave request below: Total spending:  The cost of the period requested. Overlapping shifts: If there are no overlapping shifts, no details will show. If one or more scheduled shifts overlap with the requested period, you can choose what should happen to these shifts: Delete shift(s):  The scheduled shifts for this employee in the requested period will be deleted. Keep and change Shift type:  The scheduled shifts for this employee in the requested period will remain in the schedule, but the shift type will change to the one you select. If a default shift type has been selected in the account template that will be pre-selected.  Cover shifts in Schedule:  This feature provides the option to create extra shifts in the schedule to cover for the absence in the requested period. Note:  Approving a leave request is going to create corresponding shifts in your schedule to represent the employee’s leave. The shifts will be created in the department of your choice and will appear as approved with a palm tree indicator in the top right corner. The shifts cannot be edited from the Schedule as they always reflect the leave request through which they were created.   After Denying or Approving a request, you can find the request later by adjusting the Status filter on the Leave requests page. You can make adjustments to already approved requests or switch between the approved and denied states.

Set up Xero Payroll  if you have not done so already.   Before synchronising your Planday payroll data with Xero, please consider reviewing the following points to ensure that the correct information is sent for your employees to be paid accurately.   Create a report preview To create a report preview, navigate to the Xero payroll overview page by going to  Payroll &gt;   Xero Payroll.   What is included in the report? Please enter all the necessary parameters at the top of the screen, and press the  Preview report  button.    💡 Remember, if you can’t select your desired Pay Run, make sure to create a Draft Pay Run in Xero first.   You will see a list of all the employees that match the criteria, set by filtering for Departments, shift status, Employee types and Employee groups.   The list will show employees by their first name and last name.   Check that you are looking at the correct Pay period and that all your employees are included in the preview.    View a summary of an employee's details You can click on one of the employees to get complete detail of their worked hours.   Total Shifts Here you can see an overview of how many shifts ( Total shifts ) this particular employee has worked and the breakdown of worked hours.   Type of shifts Under  Shift type , you will be able to see what kind of shifts this employee has worked, for instance, regular hours, paid leave or sick leave, and how many units (hours) each were scheduled for.   Payroll supplements Under  Payroll supplement , you can see a different overview of all the overtime and penalty rates that automatically apply to an employee’s shifts. View a detailed breakdown of all units Click on  Show details  to get an even more detailed overview of the above subcategories.   Here you can see the specific date, time of day, position or job role, and the number of hours worked on any given shift.   Handing of penalties On shifts where  penalties  are applied, for example, on Sundays or Public holidays, the overview will show ‘0’ hours under  Quantity  for that particular shift and instead allocate all of the hours to the penalty. This method of allocating the hours gives a more transparent overview while also matching the setup of the payroll reporting functionality in Xero.   Handling of breaks Both  Unpaid  and  Paid breaks  are included in this detailed overview. However, Paid breaks are included as part of the Regular hours units, while unpaid breaks are excluded from the calculations. While both Unpaid and Paid breaks show as ‘0.5’, the Unpaid break will not be sent to Xero, but the Paid break will be included in the total units of Regular hours or overtime/penalty rates if Paid breaks are applied during this period.    Handling of Leave types Leave type is where the leave requests made by employees and approved by admins will be shown. Any leave that requires an account will show as an instance of leave both as a Shift type and a Leave type. Planday will handle the request and schedule of leave, whereas Xero will take care of the payment and balance of leave.  💡Note that the Xero integration only supports leave requests counted in hours, not days.   💡  Please note:  This overview is explicitly made for Xero users. In Planday, we can create a more generic payroll report under  Payroll  &gt;  Payroll export . However, the generic and Xero payroll reports should not be used to compare each other as the breakdown of hours into subcategories differs between the two reports. The total amount of hours will be identical, but the breakdown is different, so it is not recommended to compare the two in terms of the breakdown of the hours.   Need more help?

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents You can effectively track and record revenue for your business in Planday. This article will show you how to add your revenue to Planday, track daily labour costs, and enter a forecast to track and compare your sales targets.   Enable the Revenue feature on the Schedule page First, go to the  Schedule  and press the  View settings  button. Here you can enable the  Revenue  function to start showing revenue numbers at the bottom of the schedule. You'll see some blank fields appear below each day.     Create Revenue units You need to create at least one revenue unit. A unit is a cost centre that holds both the labour costs and revenue. You can create multiple units per Department if required. Go to  Settings  &gt;  Revenue  &gt;  Units  to create or modify revenue units.   Enter your daily sales forecast In the blank fields in your schedule, you'll see below each day, enter your daily sales forecast. For a more realistic view of your labour costs in relation to revenue, enter your forecast for each day of the week.   After you have done this, a percentage will show as an indicator of your daily labour percentage. If the box is red, you have exceeded the budgeted cost you set. If the box is green, you are either on par with or under your budgeted labour percentage. You can also see what your labour percentage will be if you reach your forecasted sales/revenue predictions.   Update actual sales during the week As the week progresses, you will need to update your schedule by entering the actual sales into the daily revenue tab. This will either increase or decrease your actual labour percentage as the week continues, allowing you to make better decisions on cutting hours or increasing sales to hit your targeted labour budget.   Set weekly or monthly budgets With the basics of revenue in place, you may want to return to the revenue tab, found in Settings, to set weekly or monthly sales and labour budgets to get a more accurate picture of your performance week by week. You can also add additional payroll costs, choose to ignore Open shifts, and account for VAT/Sales tax in the Advanced tab.     Need more help?

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 This integration is for Planday admins based in Australia, the UK and the USA only. Looking for  Square troubleshooting or FAQ ? Before setting up the integration, you need to   create revenue units   in the departments you want to import revenue.   You should also be aware that revenue can only be imported on days when at least one shift in the Schedule exists.   The integration imports Gross value. It is not possible to import Net value or get information about Tax level or Tax value separately.   Connect your integration The first thing you need to do is  Connect  your integration. Head to  Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Overview . Click  Connect  on the Square tile to open the integration.   Connect your Square merchants by clicking the  Connect merchant  button, which will prompt a Square log-in screen in a pop-up window.   ⚠️ If the pop-up doesn’t appear, check that your browser is not blocking pop-up windows.   After signing in, you should see an overview of your connected merchants.   The green status icon indicates that the connection is working correctly. If there’s an issue with the connection, a dedicated status and an orange status light will be displayed in the table.   ⚠️  If a connection isn’t working, the revenue from that merchant will not be imported and, therefore, not included. This will also affect and overwrite revenue imported in the past if you are importing revenue back in time.   After successfully connecting your merchants, you can specify the  Data import settings .   Start import at  -  Choose a timestamp for import. The integration imports revenue daily at the hour specified in this field. The import will take place within the specified hour, usually at the beginning of the hour.   Get data from the past   - Choose the number of days back in time for import. This field allows you to specify how many days’ worth of data should be imported.   💡  When selecting more than one day, previously imported revenue on the Revenue Unit is overwritten during every import. It’s possible the imported values can change over the first several days as payments get processed on Square’s side. The integration imports only payments marked as complete in Square.   The next step is to link the Locations and Revenue Units. Click the  Link location  button in the  Locations  box to open the mapping window.   This page will show you the Revenue Units and allow you to link them with a Square merchant by selecting them in the drop-down. You can link multiple Revenue Units to one Square merchant and vice versa. Click  Save  to finalise the setup.   Need more help?

Looking for  set-up instructions ? Notes about Revenue Import Details Integration timing The integration imports revenue data from Square once a day. The import takes place within one hour starting at the hour selected in the  Start import at  field.  Typically, the import runs near the beginning of the specified interval.    Tax Always Included Integration always imports Gross value from mapped locations. There is no option to import Net value or get information about Tax level or Tax value separately.  Revenue Value The imported revenue is the sum of revenue values of all active Locations mapped to the Revenue unit from successfully connected Merchant accounts. If any merchant connection does not work, revenue from the merchant’s locations will not count in the revenue imported into the mapped Revenue units. ⚠️ Note that incomplete revenue values will overwrite correct values imported in the past if a Merchant account connection stops working and if you are importing values for several days in the past.   FAQs Merchant account needs to be reconnected. In some instances, authorization to the connected account can fail, and the account will need to be reconnected. The user will be informed of that state in the Merchants card where such status will be displayed next to the corresponding account. How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, the user must remove all connected merchants. This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be deleted and stays in Planday.

Verify in Square:  Open your  Square Seller dashboard   https://squareup.com/dashboard  and log in using the same merchant account you used to connect with Planday. Navigate to  Reporting , then  Transactions .   Set relevant values in the filter: The date should reflect the period you are checking. Set types to  Payments . Set the status to  Complete . Select the location you want to verify. The value you should compare with imported revenue in Planday is shown in the  Total collected  field.

Revenue imported to Planday does not match the value reported by Square Check Payments Status  The integration calculates revenue based only on payments marked as  Complete . Since payments can take up to a few days to be processed, it is possible that imported revenue will not correspond to values shown in Square, or that the value shown in Schedule will change during the next import. If you wish to compare values more accurately, filter transactions in Square by the  Completed  status.   Check Connection Status  Please check that all connections are in  Connected  status. If a connection doesn’t work correctly, then Payments related to Locations from this connection will not be imported. Need more help?

Looking for  set-up instructions ? Revenue import details Integration timing The integration imports revenue data from Lightspeed once a day. The import takes place within one hour starting at the selected hour in the  Start import at  field.  Typically, the import runs near the beginning of the specified interval.   Include or exclude tax values Integration by default imports Gross values from mapped locations. To import Net values, uncheck the “ Include tax values ” option.   Revenue value The imported revenue is the sum of revenue values of all active Registers mapped to the Revenue unit from successfully connected Lightspeed accounts. If any Lightspeed account connection does not work, revenue from the Account’s registers will not count in the revenue imported into the mapped Revenue units. ⚠️ Note that incomplete revenue values will overwrite correct values imported in the past if a Lightspeed account connection stops working and if you are importing values for several days in the past. FAQs and troubleshooting How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, you can remove individual connected Lightspeed accounts. This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be overwritten. 💡  Alternatively, click the  Options  drop-down on the Lightspeed Retail X-Series tile on the Integrations Overview page, then click  Revoke authorisation .

You can see the current status of the connected accounts displayed next to the corresponding account when you open the integration tile. To reconnect the account, you must click on the account’s table row in the Accounts section. A pop-up window asking you to sign in again will appear. You must log in to the correct X-series account.

Revenue imported to Planday does not match the value reported by Lightspeed Retail POS A. Lightspeed Retail POS – Rounding issue Sometimes, the sale total will have some rounding calculation (more or less ~GBP0.01) due to tax calculations not falling on an exact penny value. When these fractional pennies accumulate over many sales, the differences can be seen more evidently.  This issue occurs only when tax is included in the import.   B. Check Payments Status  The integration calculates revenue based on sales marked as: Completed On Account Delivery, completed Layby, completed On account, completed Pickup, completed Pickup, unfulfilled Delivery, unfulfilled Since payments can take up to a few days to be processed, it is possible that imported revenue will not correspond to values shown in X-Series or that the value shown in the Schedule will change on the next import.    C. Check Connection Status  Please check once all connections are in  Connected  status. If some connection doesn’t work properly, sales related to Registers from this connection will not be imported.   Need more help?

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  This integration is for Planday admins based in Australia, Canada, the UK and USA only. Looking for  troubleshooting or FAQ  for this integration? Before setting up the integration, you need to create  Revenue units  in the Departments you want to import revenue.   You should also be aware that revenue can only be imported on days when at least one shift is in the Schedule.   The integration imports Gross value by default. It is also possible to import Net value only.   Connect your integration The first thing you need to do is  Connect  your integration. Head to  Settings &gt; Integrations &gt; Overview . Click  Connect  on the  Lightspeed Retail X Series  tile to open the integration.   Connect your Lightspeed account by clicking the  Connect account  button, which will prompt a Lightspeed log-in screen in a pop-up window.   ⚠️ If the pop-up doesn’t appear, check that your browser is not blocking pop-up windows.     After signing in, you should see an overview of your connected accounts.     The green status icon indicates that the connection is working correctly. If there’s an issue with the connection, a dedicated status and an orange status light will be displayed in the table. ⚠️  If a connection isn’t working, the revenue from that account will not be imported and, therefore, not included. This will also affect and overwrite revenue imported in the past if you are importing revenue back in time. After successfully connecting your merchants, you can specify the  Data import settings .   Start import at  -  Choose a timestamp for import. The integration imports revenue once a day at the hour specified in this field. The import will take place within the specified hour, usually at the beginning of the hour. Get data from the past   - Choose the number of days back in time for import.  This field allows you to specify how many days’ worth of data should be imported. 💡  When selecting more than one day, previously imported revenue on the Revenue unit is overwritten during every import. It’s possible the imported values can change over the first several days as payments get processed on Lightspeed’s side. The integration imports only payments marked as complete in Lightspeed. Include tax values  -  Choose Yes or No.   By default, the checkbox is selected to include tax values added in the import, but you can deselect it - leading to the import of net sales data. The next step is to link the Revenue units with Registers. Click the name of an account in the  Registers  box to open the linking window.   Click one of the account names under Registers to open the link window. The linking page shows existing Planday Revenue units and allows you to link any Lightspeed POS (X-Series) Registers. It is possible to link multiple Registers in the same Outlet to one Revenue unit and vice versa.   Click  Save  to finalise the setup.     Next: Troubleshooting and FAQ Need more help?

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 This article is for Admins and Schedule managers. Get familiar with  creating shifts  to make full use of this feature. What are Schedule filters? Schedule filters allow you to identify specific shifts, colleagues, or groups on your schedule. Filters can be applied to all views and timeframes of the schedule, allowing you better insight while creating or viewing schedules. 💡 Filters don't modify the schedules, which means you can review and explore your filters without worrying about changes to the schedule. How to apply filters on the schedule The  Filters  button is located at the top right of the Schedule page. Click on it to reveal the panel showing you all the available filter options.   You can apply the following filters on the schedule: Employees  - Filter by selecting a single employee or select multiple employees. You can also filter by Sections within the employee filter. Positions  - If you use  Positions , you can filter the schedule based on your added Positions and Sections only. Employee groups  - Filter based on  Employee groups . Shift type  - This setting lets you filter for shifts from various  Shift types  such as Normal, Sick, Leaves, or any other custom shift types. Status  - This lets you filter shifts between Shift states such as  Open ,  Requested ,  Not requested, Assigned, Approved,  and  For sale. Shift times  - Filter by specifying shift start and end timings. For example, you can type 8 in  From  to show all shifts starting from 8:00 in the morning.   Tips for using filters Save time by using the keyboard shortcut Shift + F to open or close the filter drawer quickly. You can simultaneously apply multiple filter options to narrow down only the shifts you would like to see. Use the search bar within the filters to find the desired results quickly. You can also print the schedule, with filters applied, by going to  Tools  &gt;  Print schedule. Your selected filters will remain applied to your account as a browser setting. If you browse away from the Schedule page with the filters applied, your filter selections will stay if you return to the page. Lastly, you will find an option to  hide the empty rows  of the schedule, so you can focus on the shifts you have selected and an option to clear all your filters by pressing  Reset all , to show everything again.

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  This article is intended for users who haven't imported an award via our Award library. You can read the articles on  How to set up your own employment terms  if you're not using an Award. Use Contract rules to compare your employees’ scheduled hours to those they’re contracted for right inside the schedule. Setting these rules allows for better insight into which employees have enough hours, which can be contracted for additional hours, and which ones have exceeded their contract limit.   How to create Contract rules If you are unsure about the rules relevant to your employees in respect to overtime and their hours of work, please refer to the Fair Work Ombudsman or seek professional legal advice as necessary.    To create Contract rules, go to  Settings   &gt;  People   &gt;  Contract rules   &gt;  Create Contract rule.   In Step 1, Name the Contract rule, enter an optional description to help you remember what the contract rule is about, and press  Continue .   In Step 2, If certain  Shift types  should be excluded from the Contract rule, you can deselect them by pressing the  Edit  button on  Shift types . Such Shift types could, for instance, be Shift types that don’t count as Ordinary hours, i.e. Unpaid leave.   The start date set is the day and date from which the scheduled hours are counted. For example, if the start date is set to 1 June with an interval length of 1 week and 40 total hours, we can then expect that 40 hours should be worked from the 1st to the 7th, the 8th to the 14th, and so on. Important : If Monday is the start day of your week in the Schedule, then you should always choose a Monday as the start date in your Contract rule. You can always choose an individual date for each of your employees when you assign the contract rule to them. You can now choose the Interval type, which is either Day, Week, Month or Year. You then put in the appropriate number of hours as they relate to the chosen interval.   If you choose the Month option, you will be asked to choose between  Average  (same number of hours each month) or  Individual months  (input a specific number of hours for each month of the year).   Add additional rules for daily working and maximum hours You have the option to  Add additional rules . This lets you specify daily working hours and set the maximum hours after which overtime should apply.   When setting  Daily working hours , you can set a time interval (i.e. 7am to 7pm)  that applies to all days of the week. If your Daily working hours are not the same each day, such as on the weekends, you can also set them for each individual day of the week.   When setting  Maximum hours per day , you have the same options to either set a particular number of hours to apply to all days of the week or individually set each day's maximum number of ordinary hours. Select the checkbox if values are different for each day.

You can navigate to  How to work with breaks  if you have imported an award via our Award library. If you are unsure of what break-related employment terms are correct for your business or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. You may also wish to seek independent legal advice as may be appropriate for your business. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. Please also note that overriding the breaks required for your employee could be in breach of your compliance obligations. You should seek independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.     You can set up break rules that automatically apply a break to the shifts in your schedule, or you can add them manually on a shift-by-shift basis. If you want your employees to use Punch Clock to punch in and out of their breaks,  click here.   Please note:  Any penalties payable to employees relating to missing meal breaks are not automated in Planday, and you will have to manually adjust the shifts for the appropriate penalty to apply. Automatic breaks Set up automatic break rules to automatically apply breaks either at a specific time of day or after a set amount of time has been worked.   For both  Time of day  and  Time after start  breaks, you can determine: How long a shift must be before an employee receives a break. The days it applies to. If the break should be paid or unpaid. The Department(s) and Employee group(s) the break applies to.   Setting up automatic breaks based on time of the day First, go to  Settings  &gt;  Schedule  &gt;  Break rules  and press  Add break .   To add a break at a specific time of day, press  Add break , and select the  Time of day  break type. Give your break a name, set how long the shift must be for this break to be applicable and set when the break should start and end.     Setting up automatic breaks based on time after start of a shift If you need to give employees a break after they've worked a certain amount of time, go to  Settings  &gt;  Schedule  &gt;  Break rules , press  Add break , then choose the  Time after start  break rule. Specify the break length, then choose how far into the shift the break should begin and if it should be paid or unpaid.     Setting up multiple automatic breaks If you want to set up multiple break rules that occur throughout the day, we recommend that you have the longest shift possible in mind and add all the breaks accordingly.  Follow the steps described above to create your first break rule of the day For the following break(s), add only the additional break time and not the total break time. The breaks will accumulate.  For example, if you want to give your employees one 10 minute paid break if the shift is 4 hours and another 10 minute paid break if the shift is 7 hours, configure this as two separate break rules:   Break rule 1:     Break rule 2:     This will result in 2 x 10 min paid breaks, a total of 20 minutes if the shift is 7 hours or longer.

What is an open shift? Your managers can store shifts as open shifts in the schedule to plan for future needs. It may also be that one of your colleagues is selling a shift, which becomes an available shift to claim.   An open shift does not yet have an employee assigned to it. You can request to take over this shift if you are part of the appropriate Employee group or Department to perform the work.   How to apply for an open shift? You can see upcoming Open shifts that you can cover in the  Open shifts  widget on your app's Overview screen. Press  See all  to view all available open shifts.   💡  The screenshots are from the iOS version of the app. While the Android version may have slight design differences, the functionality remains the same.   Tap a shift to see its full details, or tap  See all  to get a list of all available open shifts that you can cover. Once you open an available shift, you will see a  Request shift  button on iPhone or a  + button  on Android that you can press to request the shift.

          <attvalue for="2" value="Table of contents Managing overtime in Planday This article will take you through a series of quick and simple steps to manage overtime manually for your business. Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents ⚠️  Instructions in this article are no longer necessary.  Please see the article  Overview of Contract rules and Overtime  instead. 💡 Planday is currently in Beta in preparation for launch in Australia. As a result, some Overtime features are in development and in this article we will take you through a series of quick and simple steps to manage overtime manually for your business. Depending on the relevant award that applies to your business and employees, your Planday organisation will be set up with an in-built award interpretation feature incorporating the Contract rules and Working time rules that apply to you.   Please note, if you are unsure of the correct Award coverage for your company or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission Awards finder page or contact the Fair Work Ombudsman to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.   What types of overtime might occur? There are several instances in which overtime could apply to your employees including but not limited to: Shift duration exceeds the daily maximum hours.  e.g. more than 9 hours per day or one day of up to 11 hours per day. A shift planned outside the employee’s contracted ordinary hours  e.g. contracted hours 08.00-17.00, scheduled 07.00-16.00. A shift planned outside the span of ordinary hours  e.g. standard office hours 08.00-17.00, scheduled 07.00-16.00. In excess of contracted hours over a fixed interval e.g. contracted hours 37.5 hours in a week, scheduled 40 hours in a week.   Splitting shifts in Planday to add overtime You can manage overtime in Planday by splitting your employee's shift and assigning the correct  Shift type  for the overtime supplement to be triggered. You can split a shift in either Schedule or Punch Clock.   How to split a shift manually in the Schedule To split a shift in the schedule you will need to adjust the planned shift so it aligns with the ordinary hours and then add the overtime as a separate shift and add the  Shift type  for overtime.   Steps: Go to the Schedule. Click on the Shift you would like to split. Edit start and/or end time so it aligns with the ordinary hours. Click save. Create a new shift for overtime. Add start and end times, Shift type for overtime and employee. Click save. You have now split the shift.   How to split a shift in Punch Clock to add overtime You can use this option if your employee has had an ad hoc request to work overtime and as such was not pre-arranged in the schedule.   To split a shift in Punch Clock go to pending Punch Clock entries either by using the pending actions widget on the dashboard or navigate from the menu to Schedule and click Punch Clock in the dropdown menu.   Steps: Go to Punch Clock. You can see the yellow flag on the Punch Clock entry indicating the end time is different from the scheduled end time. Click on the tool symbol to the right of the Punch Clock entry. Click split shift. Add the timespan for the ordinary hours and click add time period.  Now add the timespan for the overtime, set the Shift type for overtime and click save. You will now see the shift has been split and you can approve them.     Use Contract rules to manage overtime Contract rules   can help you keep track of your employees' scheduled hours in a set interval. The in-schedule traffic light system will indicate how you are going in regards to your employees ordinary hours of work in relation to their contracted or an agreed number of hours per interval.   This feature is limited to a set amount of hours and a fixed interval, therefore it can’t be used to average hours over several weeks.   To know more, read this article on how to  Create and apply Contract rules .   Use Working time rules to manage overtime Working time rules  provides the opportunity to build an advanced warning mechanism for your rostering needs. The Working time rule will prompt a warning if you try to schedule an employee in a way that infringes the given rule, e.g. exceeds a maximum shift length.   It is important that you follow these manual workarounds to ensure that your staff are paid overtime correctly. As noted earlier, Planday’s current Beta program does not have full compliance functionality in areas like overtime, so if you are unsure how to split shifts in Planday please get in touch with our support team.

A  Swap  request allows you to exchange shifts with a colleague. They'll get your shift, you'll get their shift. Perfect for swapping an early start for your colleague's late one. A  Hand over  request allows you to give the shift directly to a colleague without replacing it. Use this when you have a specific person in mind to replace you when you can't make it to work. Use  Sell  to put the shift up for sale, giving your colleagues the chance to request it themselves. If you have a lot of peers in your role then this option will take the hassle out of finding a replacement when you can't work this shift. 💡  The screenshots are from the iOS version of the app. While the Android version may have slight design differences, the functionality remains the same. ⚠️ The shift will remain yours in all three scenarios until a colleague accepts your request and a manager approves it.

It pulls important performance metrics from your existing data and brings actionable items in front of you so you can respond to the most important tasks first. Dashboard menu You can access most areas of Planday via the menu bar. Some options may not be available to you depending on your account’s subscription or user's  access level . For example, normal employees won't see the payroll, reports or account tabs.    Edit dashboard You can add relevant widgets or remove the ones you no longer need by clicking on the  Edit dashboard  button. For example, you can disable the Get Started widget if you no longer need it or add new widgets that are relevant to you.  Account widget Under the account section, you can manage your account information and your subscription. Simply press  Go to your account  to see your account overview. Pending actions widget The  Pending actions  widget can be considered your digital to-do list in Planday. It lets you know how many items are pending and require your attention, divided into four main categories: Swap requests  - Shift swaps in between your employees that need your approval. Shifts requested  - See when employees have applied to open shifts that need your approval. Punch Clock entries  - Finished shifts from Punch Clock that require your approval. Absence/Leave requests  - Take action when employees request time off and need your approval. Each category will show you how many requests you have awaiting action. If you press on a category, you'll be redirected to the request page where you can approve or deny it.   News widget Sharing information with your employees can be done through the news feed. You can also think of it as a bulletin board where you can post messages for the team. Press  Go to news  to see an overview of the news feed.

When you create an event, you can specify the date and time of the event, as well as limit the attendance by departments or employee groups. If you enable the  Use attendance  feature, your employees can let you know whether they can attend your event or not.   Birthdays widget The Birthdays widget has a more social role as it will let you and your employees see whose birthday is coming up in the next week. The Birthdays widget collects data from the date of the birth field from the employee's profile and displays it only to employees in the same Department.   Salary percentage widget Here you can see the salary percentage for one department and compare it across departments. The data is obtained by having a set revenue in the system together with an approved shift schedule so that the percentage can be calculated on the basis of the ratio between revenue and wages within a period.   Under the  Configure  button, you can select the department you want to see the salary percentage for and whether you want to compare it with your budget or another department. Revenue widget To bring out data in this widget, there must be some revenue numbers in Planday. You can set up your revenue either by going to  Reports  &gt;  Revenue  or via  Settings  &gt;  Reports  &gt;  Revenue . Both of these allow you to enter your revenue manually. You can also automate the revenue ingestion using a supported Point of Sale (POS) integration. Go to  Settings  &gt;  Integrations  to see supported POS integrations with Planday. Under the Configure button, you can select the department you want to see revenue for and whether you want to compare the data with another department.

See  Preparing for payroll . What are Payroll prints? Payroll  Prints  can add extra columns of information to the Microsoft Excel payroll export file. This data can either be taken from the Employee profile, or the Schedule.    For example, you may need an employee's email address on your payroll export so your accountant can send out e-payslips. Your payroll export can include this, customised through payroll  Prints .   ⚠️  The customisations you add with payroll  Prints  only apply to the  payroll export's Microsoft Excel and CSV format . Payroll prints do not affect PDF, Dynamic, or Integration payroll reports.   How to view your existing Payroll data fields To see existing Payroll prints, navigate to  Settings &gt; Payroll &gt; Prints &gt; CSV/Excel data fields    💡You need to have  admin privileges  to make changes to Prints. If you are an admin and cannot find the Prints tab, contact our support team to have this enabled on your Planday.    Each entry on the list displayed here represents a column on your current payroll report (only for Microsoft Excel format).   The  Name  of the field is customisable and will show as the column header on the payroll report, while the  Standard CSV/Excel data field  is the type of data that will be brought into this column.   Through  Sort order,  you can organize how the columns will appear on the report, on the smallest number first and largest last basis. We recommend adding increments of 10 so that you can easily edit the order in case you need to change it in future.    How to create a new Payroll data field   To create a new entry in the Payroll prints, navigate to  Settings &gt; Payroll &gt; Prints &gt; CSV/Excel data fields  and press  Create.  Choose from the  Excel data field  dropdown list the field you need to create. This will show all the information you can bring into your payroll report.   In this example, an Email address field needs to be added to the payroll export file.   Any Data field marked with a person icon will contain personal data from the employee profile, while the other type will be scheduling data (marked with a board-like icon). This allows you to create a comprehensive payroll report with both employee and schedule data.   Select the  data   field  you need, give it a  name  (so you can easily find it later), and type the  sort order   number  (a small number would be displayed before a larger one, in the report).

The familiar Punch Clock approval process has now been upgraded and integrated into our  Timesheets  feature.  ➡️  Get started with Timesheets  to manage employee hours and approvals effortlessly. The  Punch Clock  feature can help you keep track of time worked and attendance. You can use it to compare scheduled shifts to worked shifts and even improve your schedule's efficiency.   Punch Clock improves your timesheet accuracy, allowing you to make sure that the right employee is at the right location at the right time. You’ll spend less time manually inputting timesheet information into your payroll system and consequently, you’ll run faster pay runs.   Punch Clock is available on the web, through the stand-alone  Kiosk app , and the  Planday app . Approve Punch Clock entries from the web You can review Punch Clock entries by using the  Pending actions widget  on the homepage of your Planday or by going to  Schedule  &gt;  Punch Clock .   The Punch Clock page allows you to review and approve entries (shifts) per week or per day, see approved shifts, and get a daily or weekly overview of approved vs not approved stats.   On the Approve per week (or per day) page, you will find all the shifts that need approval by a  Schedule Manager or Admin .   Shift time  - This is the originally scheduled shift time. Punch time  - This is the actual clock-in and clock-out time. Start &amp; End : These are the times to be approved for payroll. In some cases, for example, if an employee forgets to clock out, there will be no clock-out time. This will be indicated by a red flag. You can then manually enter a time in the End box and then approve the punch clock entry. Adding an End time for a punch clock entry will also end the shift if the employee forgot to end themselves. This is particularly useful if the  Punch Clock is set up to use geofencing  or Wifi and the employee is no longer at the right location (which stops them from using the Punch Clock feature). Length  - This indicates the total length of the shift.   A single shift cannot be longer than 24 hours; if this happens, you would need to use  Split shift  before approving. Break  - This box is selected by default if your Planday is set up with automatic break rules or manual breaks have been applied to the shift. If you don't want any breaks on the shift, you should untick this box. Comment  - Here you can see any messages about the shift from the employee. You can for instance encourage your employees to leave a comment if they are either early or late for a scheduled shift. Selection box  - With the selection boxes you can pick which entries should be approved. Press the box on the top to bulk select all entries for approval. Alternatively, you can select individual entries for approval by checking the box in front of the individual punch times. Once you have made the necessary corrections, click ‘ Approve selected ’ to complete the process. If an entry needs to be removed, select it from the list and click ‘ Delete selected . Once these shifts are approved they are ready for payroll. Approved shifts and punch clock entries can be found under the  Approved  tab,  Overview per day  or  Overview per week .   💡   If you are unsure of what employment terms are correct for your business or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. You may also wish to seek independent legal advice as may be appropriate for your business. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. Approve Punch Clock entries using the Planday app As a  Schedule Manager or Admin , you can review most of the Punch Clock features through the  Planday mobile app . Besides being able to clock in or out yourself; you can also review and approve your employees' Punch Clock entries.   When you open the Planday app, if a new entry needs your attention it will immediately appear in your ‘Requests’ widget, under Punch Clock entries and also under  More &gt; Requests &gt; Punch Clock entries.   Tap on the Punch Clock entries to view the entries requiring your approval. You will have a quick rundown of each entry and the option to Approve on the spot. You'll get a confirmation and the entry will disappear from the list.    The list will contain Punch Clock entries for both completed and ongoing Shifts, so you can add an end time and approve an employee's shift if they didn't clock out themselves. 💡  Unlike on the web, the mobile app does not support adding payroll supplements manually or splitting shifts longer than 24 hours for Punch Clock entries. For either of those, please use the web component of Punch Clock. Also, please note that the list of pending entries will only show entries from the last 7 days. You can find all the previous entries on your Planday, through the web version.   Here's a quick video on approving Punch Clock entries using the Planday app:   Need more help?

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For advanced admins with full access to Planday. What does a public holiday calendar do in Planday? Public holiday calendars let you manage your Payroll supplements for upcoming public holidays, cater for national and regional holidays and let you plan your schedule needs in a more informed manner. You can have your public holiday calendars show up directly in your schedule so it's easier for you to anticipate shift needs.   💡 If you are unsure of what leave and absence employment terms are correct for your business or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the  Fair Work Ombudsman  to discuss this further. Getting this right is very important and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.   Step 1: Add one or more Public holiday calendars in Planday To add a holiday calendar to Planday, go to  Settings &gt; General &gt; Public holiday calendar &gt; Add public holiday calendar.     When adding a public holiday calendar for your business, you need to put a start and end date for the calendar. Set it from 01/01/2023 to 31/12/2023.    💡  Planday will be updating the System calendars by adding more dates for future years and you’ll need to  extend your public holiday calendar .     You can use the system calendars in Planday by selecting the appropriate calendar from the  Create from existing  dropdown. You can later modify and add further dates if needed. You can also leave the  Create from existing  field blank and build a calendar from scratch by adding the dates manually.   💡  The first calendar will be set as default and automatically assigned to all employees. You can edit the calendar later for each employee.   If your business operates in multiple regions, you can add the appropriate calendars for each state or territory. We advise you to select the calendar used by the majority of your employees, as default. That way, it will be auto-assigned to all employees, and you only need to manually update those employees that are entitled to a different calendar.   Step 2: Assign Public holiday calendars to your employees If you have added more than one public holiday calendar in Settings, you will need to assign the correct public holiday calendar to the employees that aren’t covered by the default calendar.  To assign a public holiday calendar to an employee navigate to  Employees &gt; Edit an employee &gt; go to the Employment tab &gt; select the appropriate public holiday calendar  in the dropdown and the valid from date and click save. 💡  Please note that you can’t pick a date in the future. 💡  Going forward, when you create a new employee in Planday, this employee will be automatically assigned the default calendar, which you can then edit in the employee’s profile.

You can also see start balance available at the start of the chosen period, balances accrued and used during the period and the balance available at the end of the period. Adjusting the period filter’s date range lets you inspect account usage across various time periods.   Adjusting account balance You might want to adjust a leave account balance to ensure your employee has access to leave they accrued prior to creation of the leave account. This can be done both when applying a template or later when the account is already created.   To sync up balances with your payroll system, identify the date of our last pay run and locate balances on employees’ pay slips. Then adjust the Accrual period start date to match the pay run date and adjust the Start balance of the employees’ accounts in   Schedule  &gt;  Leave accounts.   Alternatively, you can create a Manual adjustment and leave the Start balance at 0 if you prefer to make the change traceable or to add a comment. Please note that adjustments cannot be changed and the only way to alter changes is by creating another adjustment. Note:  It’s important to note that leave balances displayed in Planday are only estimates and you and your employees are always advised to check Xero Payroll for exact leave account balances. We encourage you to perform regular reviews and audits of leave accruals and balances to ensure your business is meeting your obligations as an employer with respect to your employees’ entitlements.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For experienced admins.  Assign a salary to your employees  first. Enable payroll costs in the schedule You can view the payroll hours and costs of your salaried and waged employees in the schedule to help you to plan your shifts effectively.    💡  You must activate the settings for payroll costs to appear on the schedule by going to  Schedule  &gt;  View settings  &gt; and activating  Payroll hours &amp; costs.   If you pay employees a fixed salary instead of wages, you have various options for calculating the salary costs in the schedule. In this article, you will learn about those calculation methods and can decide which method to use.   To assign a fixed salary to an employee, see the article  How to set an employee's salary . Select an employee &gt;  Edit  &gt;  Employment  &gt;  Fixed Salary  &gt;  Edit salary . In the top section of the edit window - Payroll information - you should see the data entered for your employee's salary:   If salary data has been added, go to the next section  Payroll costs in Schedule.   💡 Remember that the cost allocation and payroll are different. Salary will be reflected in the payroll as a set amount regardless of how you allocate the cost in the schedule.    Calculate payroll costs based on Salary amount In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  &gt; and then select  Salary amount .   You can see a direct calculation of this in the lower section, Estimated costs per hour. Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary amount is divided by the number of shift hours in the schedule for the current salary period. When entered in the rota, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works that day.   Example: An employee is paid a fixed salary of $2000. The estimated cost per hour - $26.67 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of shift hours in the schedule - in this case, 75. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift in the schedule is given as $160.02 (6 * $26.67). 💡  The  Payroll start day  is the day of the month from which each salary calculation will begin. This value can't be set as a higher number because the month of February has 28 days (with the exception of leap years).   Calculate payroll costs based on Scheduled hours In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  &gt; and then select  Scheduled hours .   You can see a direct calculation in the lower section  Estimated hourly cost . Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary is divided by the expected working hours in the Schedule. When entered in the schedule, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works on that day. The total cost may therefore differ from the fixed salary, depending on how many hours are assigned to the employee. The actual salary cost will not change for Payroll even if the cost on the Schedule is higher/lower.   Example: An employee receives a fixed salary sum of $2.000 and is supposed to work 60 hours per month according to their contract. The estimated cost per hour - $33.33 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the expected hours worked. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift is indicated in the schedule as 200.00$ (6 * $33.33). Calculate payroll costs based on Business days In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Bussiness days . For  Business days , select the days of the week to be included in the calculation.  For  Show in Schedule for , select the department in which to display the salary costs. In the lower area,  Estimated daily cost , you can see a direct calculation. Optional: You can change the day of the month from which the salary is calculated at  Show cost calculation each month, starting from . Confirm your selection by pressing  Save . The estimated daily cost is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of opening days in the  Pay period  (by default: Monthly). The estimated daily cost may vary from month to month, depending on the business days in the period.   Don’t show (default) By default, the option  Don't show  is set. This means that the fixed salary is not taken into account when calculating the total payroll costs on the schedule. However, it remains added for the Payroll export data.   Need more help?

When changing an employee's pay from hourly to salaried or vice versa, there are a few steps that you should take to ensure a smooth transition. You need to know the pay rates you will be setting and when the changes should occur, depending on when you run payroll. You also need to ensure that the employee doesn't get double paid.   💡 If you are unsure of the correct Award coverage for your company or your employees, we encourage you to visit the Fair Work Commission  Awards finder page  or contact the Fair Work Ombudsman to discuss this further. Getting this right is crucial and sets the foundation for paying your employees correctly. You should also seek any independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.

Set a  Valid from  date to indicate when this change should come into effect. Set the  Expected working hours  based on the selected Salary period. Set  Standard settings for payroll report  (optional) if you work with payroll integration and manually sync data, you can specify salary codes here. 💡 See this guide for  salary cost allocation  if you want to compare different cost allocation methods for fixed-salaried employees.     Next, from the  Employment  tab &gt; scroll to the  Employee groups  section &gt; press edit on one of the groups. Set the wage to  0 (zero) . This is to ensure that the employee does not get double paid. Select a date when this change should come into effect in the  Valid from  field.   c. .

Written by  Stina Klauk   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For advanced admins. See  How to configure revenue in Planday. Additional payroll costs are used to get a realistic overview of your actual employment costs by factoring in payroll elements that can add to the total scheduled cost of an employee.   As an example, additional payroll costs can be used to forecast superannuation costs (through an additional payroll cost of 10 %).   To get started, go to  Settings  &gt;  Reports  &gt;  Revenue  and then  Additional payroll costs . Click  Create  and you can start to set up an additional payroll cost, as a percentage.   There are a few more details that you can configure: Title:  Name the additional payroll cost, so you can find it later if needed. Additional payroll costs:  Add in the percentage you would like to inflate the rate by (the percentage you'd like to simulate the costs with). Wage type:  Choose which method of payment you would like to inflate. This can be Schedule costs, such as hourly rates (hourly wage), Shift rates (wage per shift), or salaries (fixed salary). Employee type:  Choose a specific employee type that this rule will affect.  By default, the additional payroll cost will apply to  All  employee types.  💡 If you need to change that, you'll have to save your changes first and then reopen the payroll cost details page, from the ✏️ icon, to edit it. Description : Optionally, you can write a note to describe the additional cost. Example: Application of the additional payroll costs on the schedule Additional payroll costs will affect both the costs on the schedule and the revenue report. Please keep in mind that as this addition only takes place for scheduled costs (as a simulation), these rules will not change the payroll costs. This can be useful when checking the Revenue bar on the Schedule page. Here is the Revenue bar, with both revenue and payroll costs displayed, before adding a simple 10% additional payroll cost: And here is the same bar, with the 10% rule attached: As you can see, by adding the additional cost, a schedule that looks under budget would come in over budget when the scheduled costs more accurately represent the actual cost of employment.

Pay period  determines how often the employee will be paid for both hourly and fixed salaries. You can set a pay period for each employee by going to  People  &gt;  Edit employee  &gt;  Employment  &gt;  Pay periods . The default Pay period is  Monthly , which is pre-selected for all your employees unless you change it. When processing your payroll from  Payroll  &gt;  Payroll export , you can select which Pay periods to include in your report. Which pay period should you set? You probably already have a pay period that works for your business and your region’s market requirements. Besides the default  Monthly  option, Employees may prefer to be paid more frequently on a  weekly  or  fortnightly  schedule giving them quick budgeting possibilities. However, it can be time-consuming to have to run payroll at a more frequent interval if you have many employees.   You have the following options to choose from when setting a Pay period: Monthly  - (default) - Employees get their hourly salary calculated for the month or earn a fixed income. This option is suitable for fixed-salaried employees. Fortnightly  - also known as  bi-weekly  or  every other week pay period . Employees get their hourly salary calculated for two weeks. This option is suitable for hourly paid employees. Weekly  - You can use this to pay your hourly or fixed-salaried employees on a weekly basis. Four-weekly  - You can choose this option if you pay your employees after four weeks (as opposed to every calendar month). This option is suitable for hourly paid employees. How to set or change an employee’s pay period? While choosing a pay period when starting a new business may be easy, changing to a new period for existing employees can also be accomplished very quickly. You can change an employee’s pay period by navigating to  People  &gt;  Employees  &gt; click the name of the employee and press  Edit  &gt; go to  Employment  tab &gt; scroll down to the  Pay period  section. 💡 When changing a pay period, you must specify when that Pay period should come into effect. Set this by selecting a future date under  Valid from.  The change will go into effect from 00:00 of the selected day.   How to set or change an employee’s Fixed salary? You can set or change an employee's Fixed salary by navigating to  People  &gt;  Employees  &gt; click the name of the employee and press  Edit  &gt; go to  Employment  tab &gt; scroll down to the  Fixed   salary  section &gt; press  Edit salary .   💡 You can read more about it in  How to set an employee's salary . Exporting specific pay periods in Payroll export To process your payroll for specific Pay periods, go to  Payroll  &gt;  Payroll export  page. Here you can choose a  pay period  by deselecting the ones you don't need depending on your payroll need. Select a  Date interval  to prepare your report. From the Payroll export page, press  Prepare report  and export your information by pressing the  Download PDF  button.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For experienced admins.  Assign a salary to your employees  first. Enable payroll costs in the schedule You can view the payroll hours and costs of your salaried and waged employees in the schedule to help you to plan your shifts effectively.    💡  You must activate the settings for payroll costs to appear on the schedule by going to  Schedule  &gt;  View settings  &gt; and activating  Payroll hours &amp; costs.   If you pay employees a fixed salary instead of wages, you have various options for calculating the salary costs in the schedule. In this article, you will learn about those calculation methods and can decide which method to use.   To assign a fixed salary to an employee, see the article  How to set an employee's salary . Select an employee &gt;  Edit  &gt;  Employment  &gt;  Fixed Salary  &gt;  Edit salary . In the top section of the edit window - Payroll information - you should see the data entered for your employee's salary:   If salary data has been added, go to the next section  Payroll costs in Schedule.   💡 Remember that the cost allocation and payroll are different. Salary will be reflected in the payroll as a set amount regardless of how you allocate the cost in the schedule.    Calculate payroll costs based on Salary amount In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  &gt; and then select  Salary amount .   You can see a direct calculation of this in the lower section, Estimated costs per hour. Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary amount is divided by the number of shift hours in the schedule for the current salary period. When entered in the rota, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works that day.   Example: An employee is paid a fixed salary of $2000. The estimated cost per hour - $26.67 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of shift hours in the schedule - in this case, 75. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift in the schedule is given as $160.02 (6 * $26.67). 💡  The  Payroll start day  is the day of the month from which each salary calculation will begin. This value can't be set as a higher number because the month of February has 28 days (with the exception of leap years).   Calculate payroll costs based on Scheduled hours In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  &gt; and then select  Scheduled hours .   You can see a direct calculation in the lower section  Estimated hourly cost . Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary is divided by the expected working hours in the Schedule. When entered in the schedule, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works on that day. The total cost may therefore differ from the fixed salary, depending on how many hours are assigned to the employee. The actual salary cost will not change for Payroll even if the cost on the Schedule is higher/lower.   Example: An employee receives a fixed salary sum of $2.000 and is supposed to work 60 hours per month according to their contract. The estimated cost per hour - $33.33 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the expected hours worked. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift is indicated in the schedule as 200.00$ (6 * $33.33). Calculate payroll costs based on Business days In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Bussiness days . For  Business days , select the days of the week to be included in the calculation.  For  Show in Schedule for , select the department in which to display the salary costs. In the lower area,  Estimated daily cost , you can see a direct calculation. Optional: You can change the day of the month from which the salary is calculated at  Show cost calculation each month, starting from . Confirm your selection by pressing  Save . The estimated daily cost is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of opening days in the  Pay period  (by default: Monthly). The estimated daily cost may vary from month to month, depending on the business days in the period.   Don’t show (default) By default, the option  Don't show  is set. This means that the fixed salary is not taken into account when calculating the total payroll costs on the schedule. However, it remains added for the Payroll export data.   Need more help?

Written by  Louise Devantier   Updated over a week ago Table of contents How do I add a break to a shift in the schedule? Manual breaks can be added on a shift-by-shift basis directly in the Schedule.  To add a manual break to a shift: Select the shift you want to add a break to. Select the edit button under breaks. Add the break, choose whether it should be paid or unpaid, select  Close , and  Save  the shift. How do I change an automatic break within a shift? To change an automatic break within a shift: Select the shift you want to change the automatic break for Select the edit button under breaks Change the duration of the break If you want to delete the automatic break, untick “Use default breaks” Please note that awards have specific requirements when it comes to the length of breaks required within a shift, please check your award before changing the duration of a break within a shift.  How do I change a paid break to unpaid and vice versa?  If you want to convert to a paid break, go to the Schedule and edit the relevant shift. Click on the pencil icon next to the Breaks section and change the break from Unpaid to Paid.   Can I use both paid and unpaid breaks on the same shift? Yes, you can combine paid and unpaid breaks on shifts either by setting up break rules or adding them manually to the shifts.    Can my business use Punch Clock Breaks? Yes, if your business is using Punch Clock, you can enable your employees to clock in and out of their shifts for breaks using the Punch Clock Break feature. To read a guide on how to set this up,  click here. Note that by default, breaks in the Punch Clock are unpaid but can  manually be changed to paid . What happens if I have added a manual break to a shift but also use Punch Clock breaks? A manually entered break will always remain on the shift as long as the Punch Clock Break does not overlap with the manual break.   What happens if I have set up automatic break rules but also use Punch Clock Breaks? Automatic breaks applied via Break rules will be overwritten, when Punch Clock Breaks also are enabled for the same department.   In the schedule, the automatic break will disappear from the shift as soon as an administrator has approved the Punch Clock entry. This is the case whether or not the employee has punched in and out. Please note  that overriding the breaks required for your employee could be in breach of your compliance obligations. You should seek independent legal advice as appropriate for your business.       What will the employee see from the app in terms of breaks? The shift details timeline displays the start and end times of the shift and the breaks during the shift. If a break is at a specific time of the day, the employee will see the start and end times of the break. If the break occurs after a certain amount of time within the shift, the employee will see: the break's start time, which is calculated automatically against the scheduled start time of the shift the length of the break, counted in minutes In the example below, the employee starts at 9:00 am and finishes at 5:00 pm. The break begins after 4 hours of work (1:00 pm) and lasts 30 minutes.   FAQs regarding Break rules How does changing a Break rule impact existing approved or non-approved breaks on the schedule? Only shifts created or edited after the change will adopt the new/updated Break rule. This means that the breaks you have approved in the system will not be affected and will preserve the settings before the rule change. Any new breaks with the attached Break rule will include the changes. Similarly, only future breaks are impacted when changes to breaks happen via the application of  Shift types  or  Employee types . How can you update past and existing shifts on the schedule to reflect the revised break rule changes? Any past or existing shifts on the schedule affected by a change to a Break rule will not automatically reflect the changes to those shifts.    Here are two simple workarounds you can try: Apply a Schedule template: If you want to apply a new or revised break rule to a specific period, you can apply a template to that period. This will help you implement the desired break rule. Edit and bulk change shift types: Another option is to edit the shift type for a selected number of shifts. After editing, you can bulk change them back to the original shift type. This allows you to make changes to the shift types as needed. How can shifts in a Schedule template be updated to reflect the changes made to Break rules? When you update Break rules, the shifts in the Schedule template adjust to reflect those changes. Here's how it works: Applying a template:  When you apply a template to the schedule, all shifts in the template will be checked against the updated Break rules. Any necessary adjustments will be made to the shifts based on the new rules. Copying a week:  If you copy a week from an existing schedule, the shifts in the copied week will be checked against the Break rules. Any changes made to the rules will be applied to those shifts accordingly. Saving a schedule as a template:  When you save a schedule as a template, any automatic breaks defined by the rules will not be carried over. Only manual breaks will be included in the template.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and Schedule managers. Looking for  spring to summer DST transition ? This article highlights what you need to know to keep your records in Planday accurate if you have scheduled shifts that overlap daylight saving time (DST) changes. When does DST end? DST adjustments for the summer to the winter seasons can occur at different dates around the year across the globe. In Australia, the time adjustment usually occurs on the first Sunday of April on the following dates: 2 April 2023 7 April 2024 6 April 2025 When the  DST period ends , the clocks are  set back one hour  during the colder months. Practically, this means that on the date when the DST period ends, the clock will instantly go back by one hour (for instance, when the clock strikes 03:00am, it would immediately become 02:00am instead. So, on this date, the hour between 02:00 and 02:59:59  occurs twice  in any given time zone). Please note that the exact time for the clock adjustment depends on the time zone of your territory, and it can be different from the example given above. This change usually happens during the night to minimise work schedule disruptions. See  Time zones and daylight saving guidance on Australia.gov.au What does this mean for you, and how to make adjustments in Planday The DST practice can have different implications for managing your organisation in Planday. It depends on your policies and the country where you conduct your operations. The following fixes only apply if you have night shift employees working at a time that crosses over a DST change. Planday does not support automatic DST adjustments . If you need to switch from DST, you must check and manually correct the affected shifts on the  Schedule  by  increasing  the shift duration or adjusting the  Timesheet entries  by adding an hour. Check and  edit the shift duration  for the shifts that overlap with the DST. As the clock changes backward (and one hour will  occur twice ), you should ensure that the shift duration remains correct.  For example:  If a shift starts at 10:00 pm and ends at 04:00 am, it should account for six payable hours. But, if it's scheduled on a DST end date and we gain an hour, you'll need to  manually increase this shift  until 05:00 am, or adjust the timesheet entry, so that it accounts for seven hours instead of six. Check your payroll data  to ensure no discrepancy or miscalculation in the number of hours worked for the date when daylight saving time changes occurred. If your payroll data depends on approved shifts and, by extension, on the duration of those shifts, making sure that the shift duration is correct should be also enough to correct your payroll data. Remember to also communicate any changes to your employees to ensure that everyone is on the same page and avoids confusion. Need more help?

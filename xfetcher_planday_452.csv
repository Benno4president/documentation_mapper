Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For administrators. Read more about  how to get started with Planday here . What are Access levels? Employees can be assigned extra  Access levels  in Planday, each granting different privileges. This feature may be helpful when you add managerial staff such as Schedule managers, HR managers, and additional administrators to your Planday setup or promote a staff member with more responsibilities.   It is possible to limit Access levels per Department. This means that an employee with Schedule Manager access can be limited to managing or modifying only the Schedule belonging to their Department. Access levels in Planday There are four different Access levels that you can assign to an employee: Administrator The  Admin  role in Planday has the highest level of access, with full administrative permissions. Admins can view and edit payroll information, manage all schedules, and edit employee details. They can also add or remove administrative permissions from other employees and deactivate accounts. Due to these extensive powers, it is advised to grant Admin permission carefully.   HR Manager In Planday,  HR Managers  can create new employees, edit employee information (except salary), manage contracts, handle holiday requests, generate schedule reports, and more.   Schedule Manager A  Schedule Manager  in Planday can create and edit schedules. They can see payroll costs per day in the Schedule but cannot view or edit payroll details. The role can be limited to specific Departments, preventing managers from editing shifts in other Departments.   Account Admin The  Account Admin  access level is the default group for those responsible for signing up and setting up Planday for their organisation. This new access level is designed to help decision-makers manage their organisation more efficiently in Planday. It won't affect your existing security groups and access levels. However, please note that the Account Admin access level is for information purposes only and does not grant access to any Planday features. To manage access and data security within your organisation, continue using the three permission levels mentioned above.   Comparison of different Access levels in Planday The following table outlines all Access levels per role in Planday.   How to give additional access to an employee To add or remove additional access for an employee, you can follow these steps: Go to  People  >  Employees  to view all employees. Use the search function or scroll to find the employee whose permissions you wish to update. Click on their name to open their details, or press the  Edit  button and switch to the  Advanced settings  tab>  Access levels. Under the  Access levels  section, press  Add  to assign additional permissions to the employee. Alternatively, you can also assign access levels from the full edit view in the new  Advanced settings  tab, as shown below:   Note that the option to  Include future departments  becomes available when you select all Departments. This means this employee will be given the chosen Access level on any new departments you create. For example, you can set this so your HR manager can always access any future Departments you create. Limit access by Department You can limit the Access level of admins or managers to administer only the Departments they manage. For example, you can have two Schedule managers who each have access only to the  Department  they manage and limit them from supervising other Departments. To adjust these settings, follow the steps below: Go to  People  and then  Employees  to view all employees. Click on the  name of the employee  whose access should be limited the same way you would add a new permission. Under the  Access level  field, edit the Access level you wish to limit. Under the  Departments  section, you can choose  All departments  or the ones you want them to manage.  This can also be done when assigning new Access levels. Press  Save  to apply your changes. üí°Please note: If you have the  Primary departments  functionality enabled in your Planday, you can choose if the Access level for each Department should be for all employees or only those with the Primary department set.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins and Schedule Managers. See a list of all  video tutorials on Wistia  or see  tutorials for employees here . This article will show you how to configure different parts of Planday by taking you through short guided video tutorials.   Getting Started How to log in to Planday from a web browser or the Planday app You need to have three pieces of information to log in to Planday. Planday URL:  This is the URL you will need to go to on the web version to log in to Planday.  Username:  This would be the  email address  you received the initial email invitation. Password:  The password you set up by clicking the confirmation sent in your email. You and everyone on your team will use these three items to log in on both the app and web versions of Planday.   How to create, edit or delete Departments Use  Departments  to separate different work areas and keep your schedules organized and efficient. Departments can also be different locations of your business or separate areas within your company, each with its schedule and employees.    How to create Employee groups In Planday, you can use  Employee groups  to describe a job, a role or a function (for example waiter, receptionist, cashier). Employee groups hold the pay rate for the employee and allow employees to work in multiple roles. They are also needed to create  Positions  on the schedule.   How to create, edit and invite employees Populating Planday with your employees is essential to getting your schedule up and running.  Create employees  by filling in their data. Assign new employees to one or more Departments and add them to Employee groups. Finally, invite your staff to Planday and give them access to the schedule.   How to schedule Assuming you have created Departments, created job roles in Employee groups, and invited a group of employees to Planday, it is time to bring it together. You can go to the  Schedule  page and  create shifts  for your employees.    Using Planday How to create and use Schedule templates Schedule templates  are the next stage of scheduling and allow you to plan and schedule weeks in advance. By creating a default schedule template, using a mixture of assigned and open shifts, you can create a flexible template that can be applied up to 14 times in one go. This will reduce your scheduling time and allow you to plan more effectively, giving you and your employees a clear view of who is working.   How to set up Open shifts Open shifts  in your schedule are shifts that are not yet assigned to a specific employee but are available to be requested by employees. You can set the start and end time, select the particular Employee group and position, define the kind of shift you know you need to fill, and leave it open. The shift will show as a placeholder on the schedule. Your employees can then request to take this available shift if they match the Department and Employee group required by the  Shift type .   How to troubleshoot logging in to Planday  ‚ö†Ô∏è One of the most common issues for logging in for new employees is that the email (username) is misspelt or incorrect. Follow the instructions in the article  Updating Usernames (email)  to correct it. Is Punch Clock asking for an  Activation code ? It may be that the device you are using to Punch in is not on the approved Wi-Fi address or your dynamic IP has changed. Ensure that your device is on the correct Wi-Fi network. Follow the instructions to  check and update your registered IP address . For employees:  What you can do if you have problems with the Punch Clock If you are having difficulties logging in, there's most likely an error with one of these details.   How to configure an employee form setup Each employee has a customizable profile that you can fill out or have the employee fill in. If you need to add more sections to hold more details than the standard fields, you can edit the setup form  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup  and add  additional fields .   How to assign hourly wages to Employees  On Planday, it is possible to set up the  hourly wage  of multiple employees (with the same rate and valid from the same date) at the same time from the Employee Groups page. Wages are set in the Employee group and thus attached to employees belonging to that group. This allows employees to belong to multiple groups but have different pay rates per group if necessary. Wages can also be assigned individually or set to apply from a specific date automatically by editing the Employee profile under the Employment tab.   How to set fixed salaries for your employees Salaries  differ from wages as they do not rely on shift data. A salary is a fixed amount based on a pay period paid monthly by default. You can choose the allocation method for the salary cost distribution across your schedule, giving you an estimate of what a fixed-salary person will cost you per day or hour.   How to communicate with staff via Planday messaging Within Planday, you can communicate with your staff directly through  messages  without relying on external social media groups or communication tools such as Whatsapp. You can send a message to a specific employee, an Employee group, an entire department, or across your organization. Employees will receive an in-app notification informing them they have a message waiting for them. You can share information through the Newsfeed and the Events tab to update your staff on general issues. You can also force an answer should you require a reply from your employees.   How to assign access levels and give employees additional roles By setting  Access levels  you can let some employees have additional access to Planday functions to perform managerial tasks. By default, there are three access levels in Planday:  Schedule Manager ,  People/HR Manager , and  Admin . An optional Account admin role gets assigned to an admin that signed up for Planday. The access areas for each access level can be seen in this  article .    How to set up the Punch Clock The Punch Clock allows you to bridge the gap between paying for the scheduled time and precise worked time. Punch Clock can be set up in a number of ways: For  clocking in from the web  on a PC or tablet with pre-defined IP addresses or Wi-Fi For punching in using the  Planday app within a specified geo-location For punching in from a physical location as a  standalone Kiosk app How to edit and approve Punch Clock entries Once you have started using Punch Clock, you must edit or  approve the Punch Clock entries  as they come. Approving worked times marks the corresponding shift as ready for payroll (green) and updates the schedule with the approved times for that shift. Once approved, the entries cannot be edited, and approved times are used for payroll.     Advance features How to configure automatic breaks Automatic breaks  take the trouble out of making deductions for break time. By creating a Break rule, you can set a pause interval to automatically appear on a shift that goes over a certain length on your schedule.   How to create and use Shift types The most common use for  Shift types  is recording sickness on the schedule and reporting this data for payroll reports. Shift types can also be used to change shift rates or add supplements. This is handy when paying different rates for evening or weekend shifts.   How to run reports on Shift types Once shifts on the schedule have a specific Shift type, you can go to  Reports > Shift type statistics  for a  report based on utilising these Shift types . For example, you could run a report to see the ratio between reported sickness and worked shifts.   How to set up Contracted availability Contracted availability  lets you see the hours you have obliged with an employee. This will let you see the specific contracted times or days an employee should be available for work. Having availability information will allow you to schedule the right people for the correct times matching their work availability. Contracted availability can be set up individually by editing an employee's account.   How to create a schedule using Positions and Sections  Positions and sections  allow you to plan your schedule when filling a shift with the right employee is more important than all employees having a shift. Scheduling in the Positions view provides flexibility, highlighting your schedule gaps by position instead of by staff.   How to configure revenue You can compare  Revenue  data against your Scheduled costs to highlight salary percentages or make other cost comparisons. Revenue can be added manually to the Planday by going to  Settings > Reports > Revenue . You can also set up forecasts and budgets to ensure you meet your goals and make changes to the schedule if you see things going over budget.   How to set up Contracts for electronic signatures You can send out  Contracts  or any documents your employees need to sign through Planday. Employees cannot add information to these Documents; they can only sign them. These files are saved on their profile and can be reviewed later. Signing contracts can be anything from employment terms, promotions in salary, work equipment loans, handing out keys or anything where you need an agreement from any employee.   How to set up Contract rules The  Contract rules  feature a scheduling tool that allows you to track the number of scheduled working hours for an employee. A red, orange, or green indicator appears around the employee's profile picture on the schedule to highlight potential scheduling issues. Contract rules can also be used for managing Flex/Overtime accounts.   How to generate a payroll report You can use the  Payroll export  function to quickly generate a payroll report in Excel, PDF or your preferred payroll integration system such as Sage 50, QuickBooks online and more. Approve existing worked hours and take action on pending leave requests before going for a pay run. See  what to prepare before creating a payroll report .   How to set up the Auto-schedule feature Auto-schedule  allows you to automate your scheduling to make it even easier to schedule more efficiently. You will need specific information in the system to ensure auto-scheduling runs effectively, such as Working time rules, Contracted availability, Contract rules, and at least 12 weeks' worth of previous scheduling data. üí° If you want to try this Pro/Enterprise-only feature, please contact our support team.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago üéØ  For admins new to Planday.  Get to know the  desktop schedule here . Various levels of structure are available in Planday for organising your company and your employees. In this article, you'll learn more about these levels, the most essential elements that constitute them and how they can be used to structure your business.   In Planday, your business and the organisation of your employees can be structured into  Departments  and  Employee groups .    The scheduling functionality has additional subdivisions into  Sections ,  Positions ,  Shifts  and  Shift   types . You can see this overview in the illustration below, with an example screenshot at the end of the article. Department : A department is a workplace unit often created for each company's physical location. Each department has its separate schedule in Planday.  Example: Restaurant Northport, Restaurant Eastend.  Learn more in the  Create and edit Departments  article.   Employee group : This level indicates in which role or function an employee works. You can manage an employee in several Employee groups, provided the qualifications allow it.  Example: waiter, receptionists, cooks etc.  Learn more in the  Create and edit Employee groups  article. As an additional unit, you can also consider creating  Employee   types,  for  example, permanent employees, part-timers and interns . This can help distribute  Payroll supplements  or allocate  Contract rules . Learn more in the  Create and edit Employee types  article.   Section : Several positions on the schedule can be grouped in a category to indicate different workplace activity areas‚Äîfor  example, First floor, Front desk etc.   Position : A position can specify what an employee is responsible for during their shift. Example:  Service tables 1-10.  Learn more about points 3 and 4 in the article  Scheduling with Positions and Sections .   Shift : A shift is used to specify an employee's working hours on the schedule. Each shift can be assigned to a maximum of one employee. Learn more in the  Create, edit ,  move, copy, and delete shifts  article.   Shift type : Shift types allow you to specify special features of shifts, separating them from regular shifts.  Examples: No shows / Overtime / Trial shifts etc.  Learn more in the  Creating and Using Shift types  article.   Example: Structure of Planday in practice The following illustration shows an example use of the structure of Planday with a fictional clinic setup. When applied to a Planday schedule, this example structure can be seen in the following way. The screenshot shows a fictional  UK Clinic  schedule as  (1.) Department .   Some shifts have been applied to the  Nurses   (2.) Employee group  in  Daylight Ops   (3.) Section . Employees will work in  Clinic room A   (4.) Positions .   While  Thompson Flash  has a normal  (5.) Shift  from 07:00 to 15:00,  Mary Jane  is there at the same time for training work  (6.) Shift type is applied.   Each company and its organisation of workforce is unique. When setting up Planday, you can choose how to leverage the structure based on your operational needs. See the screenshot above as an example. Especially in the setup phase of Planday, it is worth reading this article to get a better overview.   üí° To dig even deeper into scheduling, you will find the article  Get to know the desktop Schedule  and the collection of articles on scheduling helpful.

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago üéØ  For admins. Looking for information on How to set up automatic Break rules? Go to  How to set up automatic Break rules . How do I add a break to a shift in the schedule? Manual breaks can be added on a shift-by-shift basis directly in the Schedule. If you can‚Äôt add a break to a shift with a Shift type, you need to ensure that the Shift type includes breaks under  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types  > check if the  Break  option is ticked in the Shift type‚Äôs settings. To add a manual break to a shift: Open the shift you want to add a break to by pressing on it from the schedule. Press the edit button (‚úé) under  Breaks . Press  Add break  and set how long the break should be; choose whether it should be  Unpaid  or  Paid . Press  Close  and  Save  the shift.    How do I change an automatic break within a shift? To change an automatic break within a shift: Select the shift you want to change the automatic break for Select the edit button under breaks Change the duration of the break If you want to delete the automatic break, untick  Use default breaks Can I use both paid and unpaid breaks on the same shift? Yes. You can combine paid and unpaid breaks on shifts either by  setting up break rules  or adding the breaks manually to the shifts.   How do I change a paid break to unpaid and vice versa? For example, if you want to convert to a paid break, go to the Schedule and edit the relevant shift. Click on the pencil icon next to the  Breaks  section and change the break from  Unpaid  to  Paid .   If the break comes from an automatic break rule, you need to make the change in the break rule itself. To do this, go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Break rules  > edit the rule and tick  Paid  or  Unpaid  under  Type . Why do I have a 1-hour break when the break rule is only 30 minutes? The reason for this usually is when there are 30-minute breaks applied to shifts in the template and you‚Äôre also using automatic breaks. When you apply the template, the system will register a 1-hour break.  To fix this,  delete the breaks in the template by going to  Schedule  >  Templates  >  Edit templates  > edit the relevant template delete the breaks in the shifts that were applied with the template. How do breaks affect payroll supplements? If the option  Affected by breaks  is enabled in the settings of the Payroll supplements applied to the shifts And if you have both paid and unpaid breaks. When you run a payroll report: If the break is unpaid, the supplement is not applied to it If the break is paid, the Payroll supplement is applied to it You can navigate to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement  to configure whether supplements should be affected by breaks or not. Can my business use Punch Clock breaks? Yes, if your business is using Punch Clock, you can allow your employees to clock in and out of their shifts for breaks using the Punch Clock Break feature. To read a guide on how to set this up,  click here . Note that by default, breaks in the Punch Clock are unpaid but can  manually be changed to paid . What happens if I have added a manual break to a shift but also use Punch Clock breaks? A manually entered break will always remain on the shift as long as the Punch Clock break does not overlap with the manual break. What happens if I have set up automatic break rules but also use Punch Clock breaks? Automatic breaks applied via Break rules will be overwritten when Punch Clock Breaks are also enabled for the same department. In the Schedule, as soon as the shift finishes, the automatic break will disappear, and only the actual punched-in break will be shown. The automatic break will disappear whether or not the employee has punched in and out. Go to  Setting up Punch Clock breaks  to read more details about it. What will the employee see from the app in terms of breaks? The shift details timeline displays the start and end times of the shift and the breaks during the shift. If a break is at a specific time of the day, the employee will see the start and end times of the break. If the break occurs after a certain amount of time within the shift, the employee will see: the break's start time, which is calculated automatically against the scheduled start time of the shift the length of the break, counted in minutes In the example below, the employee starts at 9:00 am and finishes at 5:00 pm. The break begins after 3 hours of work (12:00 pm) and lasts 30 minutes.   The automatic breaks that were applied to some shifts have disappeared. Why? You can check the following: a. Maybe you‚Äôre trying to apply a shift type that doesn‚Äôt include breaks. To check this, go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types  and check if the  Break  option is ticked in the Shift type‚Äôs settings.  b. Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Break rules  > check if that break is eligible to be applied to the employee group/department/employee type that you‚Äôre editing the shift for and check if the length of the shift is eligible to have a break on it.

If you do not see this option as a manager, have your Planday admin assign you  higher access . Leave balances How can I export leave balances? Export the available balance of your employees‚Äô leave accounts by going to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or  Absence accounts ).  Adjust the  period  to have the right balance. Select the  account status In the  Filters , choose which  Departments ,  Employee groups ,  Employee types  and  Leave accounts  you want to extract the report for. Then click on  Export  in the top right corner   How can I view the overall accrued balances? You can view them under  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence account).   The accrued balance might appear lower than you expect. This is because the start of the period is set by default to the first day of the current month and not the start date of the spending or accruing period of the account.    In order to see the overall accrued and used balances you need to change the period to the start date of the accruing period until today‚Äôs date.   In the example above, the start date of the period is set to the first day of the current month and the balance accrued only shows 0.12 days. By changing the start date of the period to the day when the employee should start accruing days and setting the end date of the period to today‚Äôs date, the employee has accrued 3.98 days. If no end date is selected, the system will take into account the  end date of the spending period  of the account. In the leave template‚Äôs settings under  Settings > Leave & Overtime > Account templates , if you‚Äôve chosen the requirements for accrual to ‚ÄúNo requirements, always accrue‚Äù,   you‚Äôll be able to see an  estimation of the overall hours/days accrued  at the end of the accruing period in the leave account overview.   Why is the available balance of an absence account different than expected? Suppose one of your employees has taken many holiday days. However, the available balance in the overview under  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence accounts) is higher than you would expect. It could be that there are holidays approved in the future, and the period you selected in the overview doesn‚Äôt cover future holidays.  You would therefore need to change the period end date or remove it completely to have the correct available balance.   The account balance you see depends on the selected period. See this example on Available balance before changing the period:   Available balance after changing the period:   Why can‚Äôt I see the initial account balance of a future absence account? If you‚Äôre using automatic renewal of accounts and you have a fixed account whose validity date is set in the future, the start balance of this account will show 0 it‚Äôs because the period's start date is set to a date before the validity date of the account.  You would then need to match the period's start date to the account's start date.   Why is the available balance different on the app than on the web? On the app, the available balance will include both the approved holiday and the unapproved holiday but if you press on the account, you'll see a detail of:  the balance to date (includes the approved holiday but doesn‚Äôt include the unapproved holiday) and the available balance (includes both the approved and the unapproved holiday)    I‚Äôve deactivated an employee and I must pay their remaining holiday balance. How do I do that? You can export a leave account report. To do this, follow these steps: Go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence accounts) Set the dates in the period filter from the start of the accruing period to the day the employee is deactivated Click on  Filters  and choose the holiday account Click on  Export The final column  Leave pay - at the end day of the period filter  in the export will give you the amount to pay.    It‚Äôs advised to delete their future holiday in order to get an accurate figure of the accrued leave that they are owed in their final pay. To do so, go to  Schedule  >  Absence requests  (or  Leave requests ) > Adjust the period filter > Choose the statuses  Approved  and  Pending  > Find the leave requests > Edit them and click on  Deny .   Leave requests How can I export my employees' leave requests? Export your employees‚Äô overall leave requests for a selected period under  Schedule  >  Leave requests ( or  Absence requests)  > click  Export.  You'll then be able to choose the date range you want to look at, the type of account (either accrued or TOIL) and the departments you want the report for. Why can‚Äôt one of my employees submit a leave request? It could be because of one of these reasons: Does the employee have an active absence account? To check this, go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence accounts) > enter the employee‚Äôs name in the search bar > select the  Active  filter in  Account status  and select the account‚Äôs current period. If no account appears, you need to  assign one to the employee first  (no absence request can be submitted without an absence account. If the employee already has an active leave account assigned, another reason is that there is another request that overlaps. You can check this under  Schedule  >  Leave requests  (or Absence requests). If there is another request,  reject it first  before a new one can be submitted. Why can‚Äôt I see all of an employee‚Äôs leave requests in the Leave Overview tab in the employee‚Äôs profile? It‚Äôs probably because the wrong time frame is selected.   ‚ö†Ô∏è  The start of the period is set by default to the first day of the current month.   To see all of an employee‚Äôs leave requests change the start date of the period to the date the account is valid.   How can I make sure the leave requests go to the right manager? Let's assume an admin has access to a specific department and should only be notified when an employee in the same department requests leave. You can achieve this by using the  supervisor feature . Is it possible to book a holiday even if you have not accrued the hours? Yes, it's possible if you have enabled the option  Allow negative balance   in the Absence account template's settings.   Inactive accounts How do I delete Leave accounts / Account templates? You can delete a Leave account template by going to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  >  Account templates . Select the relevant account template from the list and click on  Delete . If you only delete the account template, this will not delete the leave accounts created from it, but they‚Äôll become inactive.  Keep in mind that deleting an account template may result in the loss of all associated data.   You can delete a Leave account by going to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts . In the account row, select the delete icon on the far right.    You must first have processed all pending requests before deleting an account. I reactivated some employees but I can‚Äôt book holidays on their leave account. What do I do? When you deactivate an employee, their leave account is automatically deactivated and you can‚Äôt change the accruing and spending periods nor request a holiday on it.  You would need to reach out to our support team so they can help you make some changes to this account or  assign a new Leave account  to the employee. I reactivated some employees but on a different contract. What do I do with their Absence accounts? You would need to apply a new account and set the start date for accruing to the start date of the contract otherwise, the system will take the hiring date of the employee.     Need more help?

Before using this feature, see how to assign  Access levels to your employees . Primary departments  is an  optional feature . Reach out to our Support team who can activate it for you. What is the Primary department feature? By using the Primary Department feature, you can ensure that managers have access to the relevant information for the employees they manage, enhancing efficiency and data privacy within your Planday account.   Let‚Äôs assume that in your Planday organisation, you have multiple departments and teams. Each team is led by a manager who manages employees across different departments. However, it's important to ensure that team leads can only access the information of the employees they manage.   To address this, you can assign a Primary Department to each employee. This primary department will be shown with a star symbol in the employee profile. By using this feature, an admin with restricted access to a particular department will only be able to view information related to the employees assigned to that department as their primary one. For example, let's say an employee works in both Departments A and B, with Department A set as their primary department. In this case, a manager who manages Department A will only have access to the data of employees whose primary department is Department A.    How to set up the Primary department feature Assign a Primary department to each of your existing employees in Planday Via Quick edit To assign a primary department to your employees via the Quick edit method, follow these steps: Go to  People  >  Employees  (1.) Click on an employee's name to open the  Quick edit  menu (2.) Click on the  star symbol  next to the department name you want to assign as the employee's primary department (3.)        2. Via Full edit To do so, go to  People  >  Employees >  Hover over an employee's name and click the  edit icon  to the right or open Quick edit and click on  Edit .

Limit the access of your restricted admins to Primary departments By assigning an Access level to an employee, you can control their access to certain departments. By using the Primary department feature, you can restrict their access to employee data tied to their primary departments. To do so, go to  People  >  Employees  >Click on one of the admin‚Äôs name, then you‚Äôll need to: edit the relevant  Access level  (1.) choose one of the selected departments and under Managed employees, choose the option  Primary department members  (2.) Click on Save   Where in Planday can you use it - See examples After assigning primary departments to your employees and adjusting your team leads' access levels, the team leads will have limited access to specific employee data in Planday. They will only be able to manage employees within their assigned primary departments in the following areas: Employee profiles Leave accounts and leave requests Contracts Employee profiles For instance, let's say there's a manager who has admin access to department B and only to the employees with department B as their primary department. This means they can access and modify information of employees whose primary department is B.  If an employee belongs to departments A and B and A is their primary department, the team lead won't see this employee in the employee list. Leave accounts and leave requests When team leads go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  or  Schedule > Leave requests , they‚Äôll only be able to view the leave accounts / leave requests of the employees they manage.  Contracts Under  People  >  Contracts , they‚Äôll only see the contracts (awaiting signature, signed or expired) of the employees they manage. Using the primary department when assigning shifts Apart from these three areas, Schedule admins can also use the Primary department feature to schedule their managed employees. The employees with the primary department will be shown with a  star  in the dropdown list when the admins create or edit a shift.   Need more help?

Getting started with Planday is easy, but before scheduling, you must set up some basics and invite your employees into the system. Follow the steps below to get started.   Don‚Äôt have a Planday account? Go to  Planday.com/signup  and signup for free trial.   In this guide, we‚Äôll use a small restaurant as an example, but the steps are the same for businesses in all industries. Create Departments Create Employee groups Create employees Start scheduling Create shifts  -  Move shifts with drag and drop  -  Copy shifts  -  Delete shifts Set up Punch Clock and approve timesheets Invite your employees Create Departments In Planday, the Schedule is organized into  Departments , meaning you‚Äôll need one Department for each of your current schedules. For a restaurant, this typically means you‚Äôll have one Department for Front of House and one for Back of House.' You‚Äôll later assign your employees to a department based on where in the business they can work. Read the  structure of Planday  article to know more about how your business fits into Planday. Go to  People  >  Employees  and press the  (+)  button in front of  All departments . Alternatively, you can also create or rename existing departments by going to  People  >  Departments  >  Create Department Give the Department a name, and if you've already created Employees, you can add them to the Department. Press  Done  when you have finished entering details about your department.   Create Employee groups Employee groups  help organize your staff based on skills and their roles in the business. Departments control where employees can work, while Employee groups control what roles/shifts an employee can cover. Go to  People  >  Employees  >  Create employee group .   Departments and Employee groups are the two main building blocks of Planday. For flexibility, each employee can be assigned to multiple Departments and Employee groups.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins and HR Managers. Skip this step if you manage contracts outside Planday and  wish to send an existing contract to an employee. With the contract module in Planday, you can build or upload contracts directly in Planday and use data from the employee information to personalise the contracts. That way, you only need to create one contract per  Employee type ,  group  or  Department  and can send personal contracts to your new hires using the merge fields function. This guide covers the following topics to create or upload a contract.   Go to  Settings  >  People  >  Contract set-up  and press  Create  to set up a contract template.   Create a contract using Planday text editor Start by giving a unique  name  to the contract. Choose which Employee groups can use this contract and set a category for this contract (optional).   Type  The  Insert text  function allows you to type the content of your contract directly into the text editor. You can use the text editor to stylize your contract and use employee data from your Planday to fill in certain fields.   The  Import Document  function allows you to upload an existing Microsoft Word document with the correct layout according to your company‚Äôs layout and use employee data from your Planday to fill in certain fields.   Merge Fields  No matter the type of contract you create, you can automatically merge each employee's information into the contract using  merge fields .    You can find a list of available merge fields   in the section below the text box with example data associated with the employee. See this  detailed document on merge fields  describing each value and their equivalent Danish values in case your Planday was set up in another language.    If entered into Planday‚Äôs editor, note that the merge fields should be spelt as they are in Planday. Be sure to use  < >  if using Planday text editor or remove < > if using Microsoft Word to compose your contract. Any custom data fields that you may have created, such as  visa information ,  COVID compliance , will have a  custom_  prefix to them and can be used in the contract.    üí° If you are missing a merge field,   create a new field  for the employee information page by going to  Settings  >  People >  Employee form setup . Once you have created a new field, it will appear on the employee's profile. Then enter a value in this field before using the merge field.   Upload   file Logo  (This option only appears if selecting the Insert text function) If you have chosen to compose your text in the Planday text editor, you can import a company logo and embed it into the digital contract with the option to position it.   Document  (This option only appears if selecting the Import document function) This allows you to upload an existing *.doc document with your layout and text. We recommend the file be in Word format so you can use the  merge fields  and thus get the most out of the contract module in Planday. See the complete list of  predefined merge fields here.   Generate test contract   If you want to see how the contract looks, you can preview it by  generating a test contract . This test contract fetches data from your profile and shows you what the contract may look like for the employee using your information.   Import your document using merge fields in Microsoft Word If you want to include information from Planday in your self-managed contracts, such as employee and company information, then you must choose  Import document  for  Type . This lets you import your company‚Äôs contract into Planday and customise it for your employee.    ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The following examples use Microsoft Word for macOS, and these steps may differ slightly in other Word versions or on Windows.    To add Planday information to your external contract, open your contract in  Word  and create a new merge field. You can do that by going to the  Insert  menu and pressing the  Insert a Field  button or the menu bar in  Word  >  Insert  >  Field.   Inside  All  categories, look for  MergeField  from the list and select it (you can press ‚Äúm‚Äù twice after selecting All to jump to the MergeFrield quickly). You can now enter the name of the field you wish to merge with the employee‚Äôs data  with its corresponding value from Planday . Be sure  not  to include < or > in your value.   To add more merge fields, copy and paste an existing merge field and then rename it according to the following instructions (or see the animation below): Double-click / right-click on the object and select  Toggle Field Codes . You can name the new field accordingly before updating (double-click / right-click on the object and select the  Update field ). You should copy the merge field from Planday and paste it into Word instead of entering it manually to minimize errors. Remember to save. After this, the field will appear in the contract template in Word and you can upload the contract file in Planday. Once all the desired merge fields have been created and the contract template has been uploaded to the system, you are ready to send it to your employees.

This may be caused by the employee name having a space before the first name or after the last name. Once this space has been removed the spaceman should no longer occur.  The spaceman can also appear if the contract file has a long name and/or filename has special characters in the name.   MergeFields not working as intended There can be a couple of reasons why the MergeFields may not work as intended. It can be because:  the value is blank in the employee data  it can be caused by the wrong input field in the document / inserted text.   Salary field not merging  If the salary field keeps coming out blank it might be because the wage is not inserted for the employee in question or, the field itself has been pasted incorrectly. If no value for salary was inserted, the salary code appears in its place.   The logo is not showing up when using the insert text function to generate a contract This feature is currently being upgraded and may have some technical issues. As an alternate, you can compose your contract in a Microsoft Word document allowing you to add your logo and use merge fields to embed Planday fields. When you upload the contract it would appear with the logo and fetch key employee data in the contract document.   Can we create bulk contracts? Not at the moment. We know that bulk upload or bulk creation of contracts is something many of our customers have asked for and is currently in the development stages.

By importing payslips to Planday, each employee can access their own payslips either from the web or through the Planday app.    In order to match an employee with their payslip, Planday uses two identifiers: Tax ID Salary ID Both of these values must be identical in Planday and in the system used for processing payroll.   Download the payslips from the payroll system as a single file, with one payslip per page. The document should not be password protected.   Import payslips to Planday Follow the steps below to import the payslips to Planday: Log in to Planday and go to  Payroll > Import payslips . Enter the start and end date for your payroll period. Select upload format. Click Upload file to upload salary slips form your Payroll software. Click Import. Payslips will be uploaded for your final approval.

Also they can get to their payslips on the app by going to  More > Documents > Payslips.   Admins can access uploaded payslips of an employee by editing their profile.     Troubleshooting If you are experiencing an issue with payslips, please note the following: You must be an  Admin  with the highest  access level  in Planday to view employees‚Äô payslips. As such the ability to view employees' payslips cannot be limited by Department or granted to Schedule managers or HR managers. Payslips should ideally be uploaded in a single PDF document, with each employee‚Äôs payslip on a separate page. This is important when using the generic import option. For some integrations, employees must have a value in their account's Tax ID field. (Without spaces or hyphens) If using an integration such as IRIS, SAGE, or BrightPay, the Tax ID and Salary identifier fields must be identical in Planday and your payroll system. If employees are unable to access their payslips via the  Planday app , try uninstalling and reinstalling the app. Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins and HR Managers.  Before assigning a contract to an employee, consider  setting up contract templates.  This allows you to set up a template of how your contracts can be applied to multiple users using information from their Planday profile with your company‚Äôs standard contract rules. Set Contract templates by going to  Settings  >  People  >  Contract setup.   Once at least one contract is ready, you can create and send a personal contract to an employee. This can be done in two ways:   From the Contracts overview screen You can create a contract from the contract overview screen by going to  People  >  Contracts  >  Create contract.   By editing an employee You can also create a contract for an employee from the employee edit screen by going to  People  >  Employees >  press the employee name >  Edit  > scroll to the  Documents  tab and press  Create  under  the contract  section.   Regardless of the path you took to get to the create button, you will reach the Create contract screen. Select the employee‚Äôs primary  Employee group  to merge the salary information with the contract. Select a contract template that you may have created. Select the  Contract start date  and a contact person, such as yourself or an HR manager as a supervisor. Click  Next  to compose the contract. On the next screen, you will see, depending on your selection of contract: A blank text editor to compose your contract. A filled-in contract template that you selected from the previous step that you can further edit if you need. An attached uploaded document with merge fields that you may have selected while creating your contract. If you are satisfied with the content of the contract, press  Save . You also have the option to download this contract as a PDF file for safekeeping.   The next step highlights the employee that needs to sign the document, shows the creation date of this document, along with expiry date (if applicable), status and two signing options:   Manually : Select this option if the document needs to be signed on paper (printed out) or has already been signed, and a copy should be uploaded for safe keeping with the option to leave comments.    Electronically : Select this option if you want the employee to sign the document electronically through Planday.   If you choose  Electronically , you must complete one more step before sending the document to your employee to collect their signature. You must first sign the document as the employer.    Allow access to Planday before signing contract Secondly, a decision should be made regarding access to use Planday (and the app) for that employee before they sign the contract:  Yes  means your employee can access Planday whether they sign the document or not. You can set reminders to notify employees to sign the contract later. No  means that when an employee opens Planday through the app, they will be notified that they have a document to sign. They will be guided to read and sign the contract before being allowed further. Select  No  if you want your employees to be made aware automatically when they open their Planday app that they have documents to sign. When done, press  Sign and send to employee  to sign the contract yourself and send it to the employee.    The contract will now be sent to the employee, and you can see it on your Contract overview under  People  >  Contracts under  Awaiting action  section.   You will be notified as soon as the employee has signed the document, which will then move under the  Signed contracts  section. üí° If you have an already signed a contract that was created outside of Planday, you can also import this on the employee's profile under  Employees  > edit employee >  Documents . See more about  uploading files and documents here .   Contract notifications and reminders To avoid chasing your employees for contract signatures, you can enable notifications and reminders that can be sent automatically.  Employee contracts  allow you to send an SMS or Planday message to specified employees when they receive a new contract that needs to be signed.  Contract reminders  will send a notification if they have failed to sign a contract after a set time. To set up either of these features, go to  Settings  >  Your organisation  >  Notifications .   You can also add a reminder for contract expiration in case the created contract has had an expiration date.   Need more help?

Follow this step-by-step guide on setting up a TOIL account template before applying it to your employees or employee groups.    Create a TOIL account template Go to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  (or  Absence, Overtime, Vacation ) >  Account templates  > press the  Create button.   Next, select  Time off in lieu account .   You can then set the details for your TOIL account template and press  Save  when you are done.     TOIL account template details Name : Set a name for your TOIL account such as TOIL or Compensatory Time off, or similar. Payment : Here you can choose  Depending on the balance  - unless the hours are always company paid or deductible. Billing mode : Set this to  Hours . Initial value : This is the initial balance of hours on the account at the date of creation.  It should be zero ‚Äú0‚Äù  if the employee starts with no hours. You can always manually adjust the initial balance for each employee even after the TOIL account has been applied. Reset day : Set this as the date when the account should reset. We recommend  not to put in a reset day  and use the TOIL account like a balance that collects hours. This way, the TOIL account will go up and down with hours transferred either as overtime or undertime. Besides this, there are other reasons to not allow an account to reset such as: The remaining hours are not transferred automatically to the new account. If as a manager, you make adjustments back in time to TOIL after the reset date, the adjustments will go to the new account instead of going to the right account. Renew automatically : We recommend not to select this checkbox as enabling it would mean setting a reset day for the account. Apply automatically:  If you select this option, the system will automatically create this account for all new and existing employees who match the selected options. You can leave this unchecked if you want more control over which employees get to have the TOIL account and manually apply the account in the next step. üí° Please be aware of the allocations you set up in this section. The initial value would automatically apply to the matching employees. However, this can be edited manually per employee should you need to make changes in the future or delete the allocations. Allow negative balance:  Select the checkbox ‚òë if the account can have a negative balance. If you leave this unchecked the account will not allow a negative value. For example, if an employee has a balance of 2 hours and you want to deduct 5 hours from their account the system won‚Äôt allow it as the balance would become negative. We recommend allowing for a negative balance. Departments, Employee groups, and Employee types:  If you chose to apply this template automatically, these options make it possible to limit which employees can use the specific TOIL account. For example, if you only wish to use TOIL in a specific  Department , for an  Employee group  and only apply it to a specific  Employee type , you can limit access with this option. Settings: Availability group:  Here you can set which leave accounts should take priority. Not applicable for setting up TOIL. You can leave this setting on  No priority (always available) .  Payroll:  Here you can set up a  Salary code  for this leave account.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins. If you are currently using Planday‚Äôs old absence module (pre-November 2021) and you want to switch to using the new Accrued Absence accounts, you can follow the step-by-step guide for  Transitioning to the new accrued Absence accounts . Planday offers the possibility of keeping track of your employees' absences, allowing them to request time off for a specific day or period. As a manager, you can receive a notification about the request and can take action immediately.   An Accrued absence account (or Accrued leave if you have selected UK English as your Planday language) is a holiday allowance where the number of days or hours are earned over time. In some cases, there is a starting balance of days that can be used.    Most accrued Absence accounts build up holidays based on an earning rate that is regulated by the local government following labour laws. The account is reset after a period with options to carry over unused time.  üí°If you want to set up a Fixed absence account where employees have a set number of days or hours to request off, you can find an alternate setup guide for Fixed Absence accounts  here . Set up accrued Absence account template Before using the absence feature in Planday, you must create an account template to allocate holidays.   Go to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  (or  Absence, Overtime, Vacation ) >  Account templates  > press the  Create  button.   Choose the  Leave account  (or  Absence account )   Here you can set the details for your account template by following the three steps below.    Step 1 of 3 - Set name and period Name:  Set a name for your leave account such as Earned vacation, Holiday leave, or similar. We recommend setting names without years so they can be utilized again.   Description:  Optional field to add a description for the account.   Renew automatically : We recommend 'Yes'. If you leave this unchecked the account will not be renewed automatically and you will need to manually create new accounts every year, when the old ones are out of date.   Accruing period - Annual start date:  Accruing period is the duration in which the absence is accumulated. Set a date from which the account should start accumulating leave.   Accruing period - Duration:  Set how many months the accruing period should be typically 12 months.   Spending period - Annual start date:  The spending period is when the employee is eligible to spend their earned leave. This can be set as the same date the accruing period starts.   Spending period - Duration:  Set a deadline for upto many months the employees should be able to spend their vacation (1-52 months).   When you have filled your desired settings, press  Next .   Step 2 of 3 - Setup Accrual rate, Requirements for accrual and applicable Shift types Accruing in:  Choose if the accruing should be in Days or Hours. Start balance : you have the option to set a start balance for the account template. This value will be the start balance on all accounts both now and in the future.  The start balance can later be overwritten in your employee's individual accounts for each period. Accruing rate:  For  Days  choose between ‚ÄúPercentage‚Äù, ‚ÄúDays per month‚Äù or ‚ÄúDays per year‚Äù. For  Hours  choose between ‚ÄúPercentage‚Äù, ‚ÄúHours per day‚Äù or ‚ÄúHours per month‚Äù. For Days or Hours per day/month/year: enter the number that fits your country.  For Percentage, here are some commonly used rates: 12,07 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 28 days 12,55 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 29 days 13,04 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 30 days 13,54 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 31 days 14,04 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 32 days 14,54 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 33 days Average working week (Calendar week method) : Read more  here . Use this handy tool from  Gov.UK  to calculate various holiday entitlements.  Max allowance / CAP:  Choose between ‚ÄúDays per Month‚Äù, ‚ÄúDays per Year‚Äù, ‚ÄúHours per Day‚Äù or ‚ÄúHours per month‚Äú and enter the maximum allowed earnings per the period you have chosen.  Leave blank for unlimited. Requirements for accrual: ( only available if the account has an accrual rate per day/month/year.)  Choose if the requirements for accrual should always accrue, or depend on approved shifts in the schedule. Shift types:  Select the applicable shift types that should count towards the accrual. These can be normal shifts, overtime and may exclude sick days or no-shows depending on your company‚Äôs policies.  Monetary payout:  Choose if the payout of vacation should be based on an average of 12, 13 or 52 weeks, or set a fixed rate. Select  Do not use  if this does not apply to your region. When you have filled in your desired settings, press  Next .   Step 3 of 3 - Customise leave account details Employee types, Departments, and Employee groups:  These options make it possible to limit which employees can use the specific vacation account you are creating. For example, if you only wish to use vacation in a specific department, you can limit access with this option. Apply Automatically:  If you select this option, the system will automatically apply this Account template for all new and existing employees who match the selected options. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Please be aware of the allocations you set up in this section. The accumulation rate, accumulation period and spending period would automatically apply to the matching employees. However, these can be edited manually per employee should you need to make changes in the future or delete the allocations. Negative balance : Select the checkbox if the employees should be able to request more days/hours than their existing balance. If you leave this  unchecked  the account will not allow a negative value. Ex. if one employee has a balance of five days and makes a request for absence for seven days, the employee cannot apply for time off in that period as the cost exceed the balance. Max consecutive leave days ( or  Max consecutive absence days):  Here you can set a restriction on the number of days off that can be taken in a row as leave. You can select "" unlimited "", which is the most common setting, or ""set fixed limit"". When selecting ""unlimited"", the administrator will still have to approve a holiday request and thus have the option to reject an extended holiday if necessary. Carry-over:  Allow you to carry over days to the next period if you want to transfer any unused holidays/hours to the next holiday year. In this case, the system itself will create a new holiday account called ""Carry over"" when the consumption period is over. When Carry over is selected, you must specify how many days/hours a maximum can be transferred and if these days must have a different/fixed holding period. If the latter is left blank, the validity of the transfer account will be 12 months. üí° This point is very closely related to the Spending period point (see  step 1 of 3 ). An example would be if your employees are allowed to carry over a maximum of 5 days into the new year and must also take them by 1 March, otherwise, they will expire. In this example, you should leave the Spending period at 12 months and select the *Carry over* function.   Please note that the carry-over account is only created at the end of your period of use (usually 1 January). This account would then be valid until 31 March with 5 days of carryover balance. Payroll:  Here you can set up a  Salary code  for this leave template. These salary codes will show on your payroll reports in Planday, for displaying detailed information on leave, and help your Payroll integration modules understand the type of leave being reported. Account priority:  If you have more than one leave account and you want your employees to use one account before they can use another, you can adjust it here. Bank holiday calendar : If your Planday has a  holiday calendar set up , it is possible to link the calendar to the vacation account. Once your bank holiday calendar is associated, it will affect the cost for created/requested vacation. For example, an employee has requested time off from Monday to Friday (5 days). If Tuesday is a bank holiday, the suggested cost will be 4 days instead of 5 days.   Default Shift type for overlapping shifts:  You can select a Shift type here as a preselected option, which will make sure that, when approving Absence requests, the right Shift type will be pre-filled as the default Shift type. Remember to press  Save  before exiting.   Visibility of approved absence requests in the schedule When an employee has requested time off and you have approved it, this will be marked in the schedule. Approved time off does not prevent you from scheduling an employee, but their name will be marked in red in the employee selector. If you assign a Shift to an employee during their time off, you will notice a red icon on that shift letting you know that you need to adjust the Schedule.

This could be if an employee in your selection already has a TOIL account.

It could also be because you haven‚Äôt entered an initial balance in the account template. Write  0  if the balance should be zero at the start. Why is there no data in my TOIL account as it only shows a dash (-)? This is because the start balance in the TOIL account template or when applying TOIL account was not defined. If you want to start from an empty balance, you should input a zero  0  there instead of no value.   View and edit TOIL balances and delete TOIL accounts Why can't I delete a TOIL account? If an account already has a TOIL balance, you cannot remove it from an employee unless the balance is clear. You can: Payout the balance to the employee. Follow the guide to  pay out TOIL hours using a Contract rules supplement . Transfer that balance to a new account manually zeroing it out and input the balance manually when applying a new account. See this guide on  How to manually adjust TOIL hours . The TOIL report shows all of the accounts - the TOIL and the vacation accounts You would need to select the TOIL accounts in the  filters  when you are in  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  >  Time off in lieu  before you click on  Export .  The balance in the employee‚Äôs TOIL tab is not the same as in the TOIL report The balance that shows in the employee profile (TOIL tab) is different from the one you see in the TOIL report that you extract from  Schedule  >  Leave requests  >  Export  >  Time off in lieu report .  In the employee profile, it‚Äôs not possible to choose the exact period for which you want to see the balance. You can only choose the year. The default period goes from 01/01 to 31/12 which means that if a TOIL account is across two years, for example, 01/04/2022 to 31/03/2023, the balance showing under 2023 will comprise the TOIL hours of 2022.   That is why we advise our customers not to put a reset date on the TOIL account template so that there are no validity dates. To have an accurate report of the balances for each account, you would need to export the TOIL report under  Settings  >  Leave requests  >  Export .  I can‚Äôt see the TOIL balance of my deactivated employees If you can‚Äôt see the TOIL balance of your deactivated employees in the TOIL account overview under  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  >  Time off in Lieu accounts , it‚Äôs because their accounts are inactive. You would need to select the status ‚Äú inactive ‚Äù or ‚Äú all ‚Äù if you want to see their accounts in the list.    Transfer of hours to the TOIL accounts Hours have not been deducted from or added to the TOIL account as they should have. Hours have not been deducted from the TOIL account although they were approved and the shift type  Time off  is set to deduct hours from the account. There could have been a change in the shift types that should count towards the TOIL account after the shift was approved so the solution would be to reapprove the shifts.  Hours have been deducted twice from the TOIL account but it should have been only once You can see in the employee‚Äôs profile that their time off hours for the same day were deducted twice but they should have been deducted only once from the TOIL account.    This can be because the hours were transferred as undertime from the contracted hours page and the shift type  Time off  does not count towards the contract rule.  Then the hours were deducted a second time because the shift type  Time off  is connected to the TOIL account, therefore deducting hours.    To fix this, the shift type  Time off  should count towards the contract rule so that it doesn't look like the employee has been planned for two few hours.    Another solution is, if you‚Äôre using the contracted hours and transfer the hours as overtime and undertime to the employees‚Äô TOIL accounts, to disconnect the shift type  Time off  from the TOIL account template and only use the contracted hours page to transfer the hours. How do I revert a transfer of hours?  You have transferred hours but it was a mistake. In that case, you can make a manual adjustment in the employee‚Äôs TOIL tab to either deduct or add hours. See this guide on  How to manually adjust TOIL hours . You‚Äôve forgotten to transfer overtime hours onto last year‚Äôs TOIL account You have forgotten to transfer some overtime hours onto last year‚Äôs TOIL accounts. If you go to the Contracted hours page to transfer them, these hours will unfortunately not be transferred onto the old TOIL account but will go to the new TOIL account instead because as the old account is inactive, no transfers nor adjustments can be made there.   That is one of the reasons why we recommend not to set a reset date to the TOIL account template so that you can still deduct or add hours to the TOIL account if you‚Äôve forgotten to do it the year before.   Supported functionalities and limitations How can I pay out my employees‚Äô overtime hours? The easiest way is to set up  contract rules supplements  under  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement .  Basically, the hours that exceed the employee‚Äôs contracted hours will show on the payroll report and will be paid out to the employee.   Other ways are:  to pay out the hours via a manual supplement;  or to add a shift in the schedule with the number of hours to be paid;  or to just add the overtime manually to your payroll system.  In that case for the three options mentioned above, you would need to make a manual adjustment to the employee‚Äôs TOIL account.  Will the remaining amount of the expired TOIL account be automatically carried over to the new account? No, there‚Äôs no automatic carry-over. That‚Äôs why we recommend not setting a reset date to the TOIL account template.  If I reactivate an employee, will his TOIL account be reactivated as well? No, it won‚Äôt because even if you reactivate the employee, his TOIL account will remain inactive. You would then need to reach out to our support team for assistance on this.  Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ   For admins and HR managers in the UK looking to set up leave. General concept All employees are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid annual leave per year.    We work out the average weekly earnings and weekly worked hours/days for each employee.    Multiply that by 5.6 weeks to get the total entitlement for the year.    This differs from the percentage accruing rate because unpaid weeks will not be included in the average.   The calculation formula is as follows:  Total leave pay entitlement = 5.6 * (Total Earnings / weeks worked)  Total annual leave balance = 5.6 * (Total hours or days worked / weeks worked)    Which shifts are included in the calculation?  The calculation aims to include the previous 52  paid  weeks' worth of shifts  If some of the weeks in the previous 52 are empty (no paid shifts), then worked weeks beyond that will be included to reach a maximum of 52 weeks, but never going back further than 104 weeks.  Only shift types that are selected in the account template will be considered as ‚Äúworked shifts‚Äù.     If a week contains at least one paid shift (irrespective of length), that week will count as a paid week. For example, a week with 5 unpaid leave shifts will not be included but a week with 4 unpaid leave shifts and 1 normal paid shift will be count as paid, and that paid shift will be included in the average. Start of week End of week Week pay Week hours Included? 09/01/2023 15/01/2023 No Pay No Pay Not Included 02/01/2023 08/01/2023 No Pay No Pay Not included 26/12/2022 01/01/2023 ¬£804.17 64.33 Included 19/12/2022 25/12/2022 ¬£706.25 56.5 Included 12/12/2022 18/12/2022 ¬£200.00 16 Included 05/12/2022 11/12/2022 No Pay No Pay Not included What happens if the employee is hired mid-holiday year? If an employee is only hired for a proportion of the leave year, the employee will only be allocated that proportion of the total entitlement (e.g., leave period starts 01/04/23 and hired date is 01/07/23, the employee will get ¬æ of the total entitlement calculated).    At which rate does the employee get their yearly annual leave entitlement? Total entitlement for the year will be an evolving average that is initially calculated from the first day of the leave year, so can go up or down after every passing day. Employees will not have access to the total balance from the start. The total leave balance will gradually trickle into the account on a day-by-day basis until the last day of the leave year at which point the entirety of the balance will have been added to the employee‚Äôs account. Calculation is done as per this formula:   Balance today = Total entitlement * (days elapsed in leave year / total days in leave year). For example: 5.6 weeks * (61/365) = 0.94 weeks balance today. The following example shows Employee 1 who works on average 20 hours a week for ¬£10/h, earning on average ¬£200 a week on working weeks. Their total entitlement for the whole leave year will be ¬£1120 over 112 hours.   After 2 months: Employee 1 will have 19.02 hours out of 112 hours in their account   After 9 months: Employee 1 will have 84.69 hours out of 112 hours    After the whole leave year: Employee 1 will have 112 hours out of 112 hours    Example calculation Hourly account: Employee 1 (who was  hired before the start of the leave year ) has worked  500 hours  over  25 weeks  in the last 104 weeks, earning a total of  ¬£5000 Total leave pay for this holiday year = 5.6 * 5000/25 = 5.6 * ¬£200 = ¬£1,120  Total hours of annual leave available = 5.6 * 500/25= 5.6 * 20 = 112 hours  Employee 2 has also worked  500 hours  over  25 weeks , earning a total of  ¬£5000.  However, they were hired on  30/04/22 ,  30 days  into the leave year:  Days hired in leave year = (365 ‚Äì 30) / 365 = 92%  Total leave pay for this holiday year = 0.92 * 5.6 * 5000/25 = ¬£1027  Total hours of annual leave available = 0.92 * 5.6 * 500/25 = 102.7 hours    Daily account: Employee 1 (who was  hired at the very start of the leave year ) has worked  80 days  over  20 weeks  in the last 104 weeks, earning a total of  ¬£6000 Total leave pay for this holiday year = 5.6 * 6000/20 = 5.6 * ¬£300 = ¬£1,680 Total days of annual leave available = 5.6 * 80/20 = 5.6 * 4 = 22.4 days Employee 2 has also worked  80 days  over  20 weeks , earning a total of  ¬£6000 . However, they were  hired on 01/07/22 ,  183 days  into the leave year: Days hired in leave year = (365 ‚Äì 183) / 365 = 50% Total leave pay for this holiday year = 0.5 * 5.6 * 6000/20 = ¬£840 Total days of annual leave available = 0.5 * 5.6 * 80/20 = 11.2 days     Need more help?

All (approved):  This balance is calculated based on the total approved overtime / time off shifts. All dates are taken into account, meaning if the employee has an approved overtime / time off future shift, it will affect this balance. Today (approved and requested):  This balance is much like the ""Today (approved)"" but also includes the shifts that haven't been approved up until today. If this balance deviates from the ""Today (approved)"" this means the employee has overtime / time off shifts that haven't been approved, yet. All (approved and requested):  This balance takes all overtime / time off shifts, past and future, into account. If the employee has any overtime / time off shifts, approved or unapproved, they will be taken into account here. üí°Please keep in mind, that an unapproved overtime / time off shift is referred to here as ""requested"".

How to manually adjust TOIL hours You can make adjustments to the TOIL account directly from the employee‚Äôs profile should you need to make manual adjustments.  Let‚Äôs say you have paid two hours for one of your employees. You now want to adjust these hours in their account. Go to the  Employee‚Äôs profile  >  Time off in Lieu  > press  Create .

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents If you are an admin who wants to automate daily tracking and allocation of Time off in lieu (TOIL) and use the Punch Clock to track worked hours, then this should be your preferred method. This option is handy because when you approve Punch Clock entries via the Punch Clock page the hours ‚Äì be it overtime or undertime are automatically transferred into the overtime account.  You would need to do three things on your Planday for this to work. Read more below.   The deviation rules in relation to TOIL are not really used in the UK and in Germany because they handle TOIL on weekly intervals for their salaried staff and not day by day.   Step 1. Create Shift types to handle overtime and undertime With Punch Clock deviation rules, employees should be scheduled according to their  Contracted hours  each day, as the deviations are generated based on scheduled hours.  You would primarily need to set up  Shift types  to label your overtime and your undertime. For example, create a Shift type  Plus hours (Overtime)  and another named  TOIL Time off  - by going to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types .    In Denmark, the adjustment rate for Flex - or afspadsering and Flex + is 100% and the hours are usually counted in the Payroll report. In Norway and Sweden, both shift types Flex + and Flex - usually have an adjustment rate of 100% and the hours are set to count in the payroll report so the managers know how many Flex hours each employee has in Planday. However, they usually handle Flex on a separate payroll system so to make sure nothing gets over to the payroll system you need to ignore the salary codes assigned to shift types. You can set to ignore salary codes under  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Prints  > Ignore salary codes.   To know more about Shift types, read the  article on creating and using Shift types .   Step 2. Create Deviation rules and link them to Shift types Next, you need to create  Deviations from scheduled time  rules so that the system will compare the Punch Clock entry to the scheduled time and if there is a deviation, the system suggests: IF Shift length not reached. (Undertime) ‚Üí THEN  Apply TOIL Time off Shift type. IF Shift length exceeded. (Overtime) ‚Üí THEN  Apply Plus hours (Overtime) Shift type. Go to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Deviations from scheduled time  and press  Create .   The example below shows a deviation rule for  TOIL Time off  which applies to Deviation type  Shift length not reached  with the  Minimum length  and  Start of shift  set to zero for a maximum  Length  of 2 hours (120min).    The example below shows a deviation rule for  Plus hours (Overtime)  which applies to Deviation type  Shift length exceeded  which has to apply if the deviation is at least 15 minutes, for a maximum of 2 hours (120min).   Name:  Give a name to the deviation rule. Deviation type : For  overtime , choose ‚ÄúShift length exceeded‚Äù, for  Undertime  choose ‚ÄúShift length not reached‚Äù. Final shift type : Choose the Shift type that will apply when the rule applies.  Sort order:  Not applicable for setting up in this example.  Minimum length : This defines the minimum duration for the deviation before it is handled by this rule. 0 means that the rule is applied to all deviations. In other words, if you put a value other than zero here the deviation has to be a minimum  that  value before it's handled by this rule. If you put 15 here, then the deviation has to be a minimum of 15 minutes before the rule kicks in. If it's under 15 then the Shift type will remain Normal.  Start of shift : This defines when this rule is starting in a deviation as time in minutes. 0 means that the rule applies to all deviations. If you put in a value here, for example, 15 minutes and choose the deviation type Arrives early and choose the final Shift type as  Plus hours (Overtime)  then the Shift type will be applied to the period between the time the employee punches in and the 15 minutes before the shift starts.  Length : Defines depth in deviation for this rule to process as time in minutes. This is the maximum length the deviation can handle. For example, if you put 120 minutes (2 hours), this means that the employees can only get two hours of overtime when the shift length is exceeded.  Step 3. Map Shift types with the TOIL account In the next step, you need to map the correct Shift types with their corresponding TOIL account so that overtime or undertime can be counted. Go to  Settings > Leave & Overtime > Advanced > Shift types for Time off in lieu accounts  tab.    In this example  Overtime   is selected for  Shift types adding to TOIL accounts balance.  For  Time owing shift types (minus) , select the related shift type in this example  Time off (TOIL) .       üí°  If you make changes to the shift types in these settings after the shifts have been approved or saved, this will not affect the TOIL balance. You would need to reapprove the shifts or resave them.    View deviations in Punch Clock approval When this is set up, the overtime account will fluctuate up and down as the employees‚Äô shift is either exceeded or not reached.   For example, if an employee is scheduled to work from 18:00 to 23:00 for a 5 hours shift but stamps 17:38-00:27, then the system will automatically detect that there is almost two hours deviation 0:22m+01h:27m=01h:49m from their original scheduled time and accounts that as overtime. In the Punch Clock page under  Schedule  >  Punch Clock  the deviations will appear as below:   If this is approved, overtime hours will be added to the employee‚Äôs TOIL account. This can be seen by going to  People >  Employees  > click on an employee and press  Edit  >  Time off in lieu  tab .  The deviations in the account will appear as below for an individual employee:   üí°Please note that the approved hours are shown as a decimal value.    You can choose to  pay out the hours at the end of your payroll period . Else employees can request leave from their earned overtime balance.

How to set up carry-over Carry-over  is a function that allows you to transfer the unused leave balance from an expiring account period to the next.   üí°  The settings of your Leave account determine when the carry-over date will take place. You can set up carry-over in step 3 of 3 ( Accrued  or  Fixed ) when creating a Leave account template or by editing an existing leave account template.

Enter a date under  Limited until . If you leave it blank, the carry-over account will be valid for 12 months. How does carry-over work? If  carry-over  is activated, the system will automatically create a new carry-over account at the end of the vacation year and transfer the carry-over balance to it. The newly created carry-over account: will appear in your overview and can be used for leave requests by the employees who were assigned the previous account. Requesting leave from the carry-over account is only possible after the account is created -- not before. is not meant to replace the main leave account but exists separately from it.

Example of a carry-over account ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  The screenshot above shows an expired leave account and an example carry-over account that has been generated. An employee has the Leave account  Leave  that expires on Dec 31st and allows a  maximum of 5 days  carry-over that expires on Mar 31st. Before the account expiry  ‚Äì On Dec 31st, the employee has  9   leave   days left  (24 accrued minus 15 used). If this leave is not utilised (requested and approved by a manager) and the account expires, the leftover leave balance will be moved to a new carry-over account. After the account expiry  ‚Äì On Jan 1st, the system creates a new account called  Leave - Carry over  with a spending period from Jan 1st to Mar 31st.  5 leave days  are carried over as specified in the Leave template. The unused 4 days will expire, and the lapsed  Vacation  account can no longer be used for requesting leave. Best practices before the Leave account expires To ensure a smooth transition from one account period to the next, there are a few recommendations you can follow:   Collect and take action on leave requests Remind your employees in advance before the end of your vacation year to  submit their leave requests , possibly by giving them a deadline. If you have other managers in your organisation, ask them to  act on all leave requests  in their Departments before the leave account expiry.  Corrections will not be possible after the expiration date ‚Äì Therefore, it is  essential  to review the accounts and leave requests earlier and  make any necessary adjustments .   Get an overview of the Leave account settings To do this, navigate to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts.  Here you can  Filter  by Account names and/or type in the name of the employee in the search bar. After selecting an account, you review and modify its settings: if the carry-over is enabled. how many days/hours can be carried over to the next period. will the carry-over account have an expiry date. If you want to edit the  Limited until  date (deadline by which carry-over balance can be used), you can do so in the existing account settings for each employee. Repeat this step for other employees. For future accounts, change the settings in the template by navigating to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  (or  Absence, Overtime, Vacation ) >  Account templates  > choose template > edit the  Carry over  settings accordingly.   Download a leave overview report If you need an overview of all balances on the last day, you can get it by downloading a  Leave accounts report.  Go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or  Absence accounts ) >  Export . The report will be an excel file, which you can filter or sort by  Account name ,  Valid from  and  Valid until  to see the relevant results.   How to disable carry-over You can disable carry-over in your template by deselecting  Allow carry-over for the next period . To edit your existing account templates, go to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  (or  Absence, Overtime, Vacation ) >  Account templates . ‚ö†Ô∏è  Deselecting the carry-over option on a Leave account template does not affect already created accounts from that template.

In Denmark, new regulations have been put in place since 2020. According to the  new Danish Holiday Act , employees will be able to take vacation days as they earn them. In other words,  Accrued vacation  is based on the continuous accumulation of vacation days based on worked hours. Rather than getting a fixed balance of vacation days at the beginning of a year, your employees will earn vacation days ‚Äî and can use them ‚Äî as they go.    Setting up Accrued vacation for your organization In Planday, Accrued vacation is handled in a few steps:  Create a template Absence account Create Absence accounts for your employees Create Absence requests Act on Absence requests Here is a brief video introduction, to get you started quickly:  1. Create a template Accrued vacation account   The first step for handling accrued vacations for employees starts with creating a template and setting up the shared details.  Go to  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types,  and select  Create .    Select  Accrued vacation account  and continue to set up your template:  Name:  The account name will help you identify the Absence account template you need when connecting it to an employee's profile.  Description : If there are details that should be specified about your template, this would be a good place to note them. Renew automatically : If the account should be renewed automatically at the end of the accruing period. Accruing period  for the account through the  annual start date  (defines which date of the year should the accruing period start or renew) and  duration  (determines for long your employees can accumulate vacation days is or after how many months the balance will reset).  Spending period  for the account also through an  annual start date  (defines from which date of the year the accumulated vacation days can be used or when they expire) and duration (determines how long your employees will have to spend accumulated vacation days).  According to the  new Danish Holiday Act , the accruing period should start on the 1st of September and last for 12 months, while the spending period should start on the 1st of September but last for 16 months.  As an example, this means that the vacation days an employee has accumulated from the 1st of September 2020 to the 1st of September 2021 can be used between the 1st of September 2020 and the 31st of December 2021, as they accumulate.    Click  Next  to set the specifics for how your employees will accumulate vacation days:  define whether their balance is accumulated/ accruing in  days or hours.  set the  accruing rate  which defines the ratio for the accumulation of vacation days per worked period. set the  max. allowance  for the number of vacation days an employee can accrue per month or per year. If you don't want to set a maximum limit, simply leave the field empty.   If you set the template to accrue in hours, then the maximum allowance will also have to be set for hours  choose if the  requirements for accrual  should be based on only the accrual rate, or depend on approved shifts in the schedule. The  Next  step in your template creation allows you to set who can use an Absence/vacation account created from this template and how they can use it:  Employee type : which of your employees will the configuration from this template apply for? The employee types in the list will the Employee types you defined under  Settings  >  People  >  General  >  Employee types . Create automatically : If the account should be created automatically for all employees when they are created in the system.  The account will only be created for employees that belong to one of the chosen Employee types above. depending on your organization's policy, you might allow your employees to take a few vacation days they haven't yet earned. This will appear as a  negative balance  (until they earn the amount back) and here is where you can decide how many vacation days they would be able to take in advance.  you can also set up a limit for how many  vacation days  your employees can use  in a row . This could be useful if you need to keep a close eye on the work balance for employees, so it can automatically trigger a warning when an employee's request exceeds this limit.  the  Carry over  option will automatically transfer the unused days to the next accruing period if allowed and within the maximum number of days.  the  Salary code  can help you automate how the vacation days (and their monetary impact) will appear on the payslips and the payroll reports.  Priority : if your organization requires more than one vacation account per employee, you can decide in the account's template whether it should be used first, last, or simply depend on how many days are left in the account balance.  and lastly, make sure to take into account the  Bank Holiday calendar  (so your employees don't accidentally use vacation days for legal holidays).  This can also be set individually on each employee's account later. Click  Save  and your template account is ready.    Choose shift types for accrued vacation   If you chose the  Requirements for accrual  to be  Approved shifts  in the Account type, you will need to choose which shift types that accrue vacation for an employee. Go to Settings > Absence, Overtime, Vacation > General > Shift types for accrued account. Here you can choose which shift types that will accrue vacation. Normal is shifts where no shift type has been selected.   To make sure you have everything covered, check out this video:   2. Create Absence accounts for your employees   Head over to  Schedule  >  Absence accounts  to start assigning and attributing Absence accounts to your employees. This is also an overview page that can give you a quick insight into the standing of your employees' vacation accounts.    From the top right corner, click  Create  and choose whether you want to assign Absence accounts in bulk or configure them individually, per employee.    When you set up vacation accounts for your employees, you are effectively making copies of your template account and filling in the individual details. This will include: which date will mark the  start of the accruing period  (if the employee joined after the start of the accruing period in your organization, it should be set to that employee's hired date) make sure to take into account the  Bank Holiday calendar  (so your employees don't accidentally use vacation days for legal holidays).  if you are setting this up after the accruing period and the spending period have started, there might be situations in which an employee has already accumulated vacation days or has already been on vacation for a few days. You should those details in the  Start balance  section.  if you've configured the  Carry over  setting for the template account (see above), the carry over amount will reflect the number of days you've already allowed.  Save  your changes and repeat the process as needed. When a new accruing period will start, this will automatically be applied to the employees benefiting from a vacation account (from that template).    To make sure you have everything covered, check out this video:    3. Create Absence requests With the setup done and all the details in place, your  employees can request vacation days , as they need.    This video shows how your employees will request vacation, with your setup:   You can share this video with your employees, to have all the info they need to make a vacation request.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago To switch from Planday's absence module to the new accrued Absence accounts, you have two options: Transition at the start of the new holiday year  (recommended by Planday). You'll only need to transfer requests already made for the coming year. Transition during the holiday year.  You may have to adjust each employee's current balance individually and transfer requests between the cut-off date and the end of the holiday year (possibly into the next year). Follow the step-by-step guide below, to transition from your current/old Absence accounts to the new accrued Absence accounts. Settings in the old account type: Under  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types  > Edit account type, you will need to remove ‚Äúcreate automatic‚Äù and ‚Äúrenew automatic‚Äù from the current/old Absence accounts. This means that no more accounts are created for this account type and that any unused accounts are automatically deleted. Create a new account type  with the decided terms and policies Apply leave accounts to your employees , with the chosen start date and correct start balance for your employees. Set the start date of the accounts to the desired transit date. If the account starts in the middle of a vacation year, then you have to remember to input used absence on their accounts, to ensure the absence days used already get deducted from the balance. From  Schedule  >  Absence requests  >  Export , export the pending and approved absence requests from the transit date and beyond, from the old absence account. Deny those absence requests and afterward create a new request for the same period and employee on the new accounts option to let the employee know that their requests are not getting denied, but rather moved to the new account (a comment can be added when a request is denied). Invalidate the old accounts If the transit date is in the middle of a vacation year, you need to change the end date of the old accounts to the transit date (the date where the new accounts start). This can be done from  Schedule  >  Absence accounts  > Edit accounts > change the end date. When the above steps are done, you and your employees are ready to start using the new accrued Absence accounts.   Need more help?

In order to use this feature, the employee should be scheduled according to their  Contracted hours  by setting up Contract rules and applying them to each employee as the deviations are generated based on scheduled hours. Once the hours have been approved the manager can go to the  Contracted hours  page to transfer the hours that are over or under the employee‚Äôs contracted hours to their TOIL account.   Setup & apply Contract rules You would primarily need to set up your employees‚Äô  Contract rules  under  Settings > People > Contract rules .  In this example, a 40hr contract rule is set up.   This rule is then applied to an employee by going to  People  >  Employees  > select the employee you wish to apply and press  Edit  >  Personal details  >  Payroll  >  Contract rule .    Manage compensation leave If you‚Äôre using the contracted hours, compensation leave can be managed in two ways:  1. You don‚Äôt need to schedule the employees when they are on TOIL leave.  Then you can transfer the difference from the Contracted hours page like an undertime manually. The advantage is that there is full discretion over the overtime management since TOIL is not visible in the schedule. 2. You can use a Shift type (TOIL) that will not count as hours worked or be connected to the overtime account.  If you want to transfer hours as an undertime, you can use a Shift type but you shouldn‚Äôt map this Shift type with the overtime account template as this will cause a double transfer of the hours. Then you need to make sure that this Shift type doesn‚Äôt count like worked hours in the contract rules, otherwise the hours with this Shift type won‚Äôt be deducted from the TOIL account. To check this, go to  Settings > People > Contract Rules > Edit  the rule   and untick the shift types that shouldn‚Äôt count as hours worked.   For example,  ShiftType_TimeOff  is unchecked here. This means that these hours are not counted as hours worked and therefore, hours as undertime can be transferred into the overtime account.   The advantage is that compensation leave  is visible on the schedule  so the information is clear to the admins and schedule admins.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents To better understand the different steps and processes of managing Time off in lieu (TOIL) and overtime in Planday, consider the following flow. Step 1: Create a TOIL account template TOIL account templates  define how overtime is dispensed to employees. In the template, you can set the starting balance, if the accounts can be applied automatically to the employees, whether to allow a negative balance and define which employees or groups can use TOIL. Step 2: Apply TOIL account template to employees If you did not choose the automatic apply option when creating the template, you can  manually assign TOIL accounts to one employee or an Employee group . When applying a template, you can set the application criteria based on Shift types or manually set the overtime balance. Step 3: Allocate TOIL depending on the frequency of use TOIL should be automatically managed with the Punch Clock by setting up deviation rules. This method is preferred if you want a daily overview of how much is taken/added to your employees' balances because the new balance will show as soon as the shifts have been approved. You can handle TOIL manually by applying specific overtime Shift types to shifts or by using Contracted hours if you need to do so on a weekly or monthly basis. See the guides below on setting up each method.  3A How to handle TOIL with the Punch Clock deviation rules If you use  Punch Clock  functionality on Planday, you can use deviations to automate the process of registering overtime and time off. You can always find the TOIL balance on the given account under the employee's profile or by going to the  Time off account overview  under  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  >  Time off in Lieu accounts .  See this article on  handling TOIL using Punch Clock deviations . 3B How to handle TOIL with Shift types The most manual and straightforward solution for registering overtime is using  Shift types . With this solution, you create a Shift type, for example,  overtime  and  time off  and use that to allocate TOIL. Employees' time is automatically transferred to plus or minus on their TOIL account when a Shift type is applied to their shift. See this article on  handling TOIL using Shift types . 3C How to handle TOIL with Contracted hours This option assumes that you already use  Contract rules  on your portal. When employees work according to a contract rule, for example, 160 hours per month, the system will register all hours below or above the 160 hours within a monthly interval, such as overtime or time off. At the end of the month, a manager or administrator simply has to review the hours and transfer them to the employee‚Äôs TOIL account if everything looks as it should. Otherwise, manual changes can be made to the shifts before approving and transferring hours. See this article on  handling TOIL with Contracted hours .   View or edit TOIL and overtime balances Managers can always make manual adjustments to TOIL accounts, such as deleting transferred hours or adjusting the balance when TOIL is paid off by going to the employee‚Äôs account.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents Planday offers the possibility of keeping track of your employees' absences, allowing them to request time off for a specific day or period. As a manager, you can receive a notification about the request and can take action immediately.    A fixed Absence account has a stipulated amount of days or hours per year from which the employee deducts holidays. A fixed account does not accrue or earn holidays on an ongoing basis and is reset every year with options to carry over unused time. Follow this step-by-step guide on setting up fixed account templates and then apply them to your employees or employee groups. üí° If you want to set up an Accrued account with the option to add an accruing rate per year, month, day, or in percentage, you can find an alternate setup guide for Accrued Absence accounts  here . Set up a fixed Absence account template Before you can start using the absence module, you need to create a leave account template to allocate holidays from.   Go to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  (or  Absence, Overtime, Vacation ) >  Account templates  > press the  Create  button.   Choose the  Leave account  (or  Absence account )   Here you can set the details for your account template by following 3 steps. Below we show an example of how to complete the 3 steps when creating an Account for a fixed holiday.   Step 1 of 3 - Set name and period Name : Set a name for your leave account such as Salaried vacation, Maternity leave, or similar. For example, you can set up a Fixed Absence account balance to indicate the maximum paid sick leave an employee is allowed to have and allocate days from it throughout the year. We recommend setting names without years so they can be utilized again. Description:  Here you can give your account a description if you want. (optional) Renew automatically : We recommend 'Yes'. If you leave this unchecked the account will not be renewed automatically and you will need to manually create new accounts every year, when the old ones are out of date. Accruing period:  As this is a fixed account, set the date from when your company's vacation year starts and the duration of your vacation period. Spending period - Annual start date:  The spending period is when the employee is eligible to spend their assigned leave. This can be set as the same date the leave period starts. Spending period:  Set a deadline for up to many months the employees should be able to spend their vacation (1-52 months). When you have filled your desired settings, press  Next .   Step 2 of 3 - Setup start balance  Accruing in:  Under the  Starting balance  field, enter the value of days or hours per year. You can change this value for the specific employee. The starting balance as stated here will be the balance that can be seen on each employee's absence account each time a new consumption period starts.   Accruing rate:  When creating a fixed holiday account, select "" Do not use "" under the Accruing rate.    Monetary payout:  Select Do not use.    Step 3 of 3 - Customise account details  Employee types, Departments, and Employee groups:  These options make it possible to limit which employees can use the specific vacation account you are creating. For example, if you only wish to use vacation in a specific department, you can limit access with this option.   Apply Automatically:  If you select this option, the system will automatically apply this Account template for all new and existing employees who match the selected options. üí°  Please be aware of the allocations you set up in this section. The number of fixed holidays, accumulation period and spending period would automatically apply to the matching employees. However, these can be edited manually per employee should you need to make changes in the future or delete the allocations. Negative balance : Select the checkbox if the employees should be able to request more days/hours than their existing balance. If you leave this  unchecked  the account will not allow a negative value. Ex. if one employee has a balance of 5 days and makes a request absence for 7 days, the employee cannot apply for time off in that period as the cost exceed the balance.   Max consecutive leave days ( or  Max consecutive absence days):  Here you can set a restriction on the number of days off that can be taken in a row as leave. You can select "" unlimited "", which is the most common setting, or ""set fixed limit"". When selecting ""unlimited"", the administrator will still have to approve a holiday request and thus have the option to reject an extended holiday if necessary.   Carry over:  Allow you to carry over days to the next period if you want to transfer any unused holidays/hours to the next holiday year. In this case, the system itself will create a new holiday account called ""Carry over"" when the consumption period is over. When Carry over is selected, you must specify how many days/hours a maximum can be transferred and if these days must have a different/fixed holding period. If the latter is left blank, the validity of the transfer account will be 12 months. üí° This point is very closely related to the Spending period point (see step 1 of 3). An example would be if your employees are allowed to carry over a maximum of 5 days into the new year and must also take them by 1 March, otherwise they will expire. In this example, you should leave the Spending period at 12 months and select the *Carry over* function. Please note that the carry over account is only created at the end of your period of use (usually 1 January). This account would then be valid until 31 March with 5 days of carryover balance. Payroll:  Here you can set up a  Salary code  for this leave template. These salary codes will be based on your payroll reports, for displaying detailed information on leaves, and help your Payroll integration modules understand the type of leave being reported. Account priority:  If you have more than one leave account and you want your employees to use one account before they can use another, you can adjust it here. Bank holiday calendar : If your portal has a holiday calendar set up, it is possible to link the calendar to the vacation account. Once your bank holiday calendar is associated, it will affect the cost for created/requested vacation. For example, an employee has requested time off from Monday to Friday (5 days). If Tuesday is a bank holiday, the suggested cost will be 4 days instead of 5 days.   Default Shift type for overlapping shifts:  You can select a Shift type here as a preselected option, which will make sure that, when approving Absence requests, the right Shift type will be pre-filled as the default Shift type. Remember to press  Save  before exiting.   Visibility of approved absence requests in the schedule When an employee has requested time off and you have approved it, this will be marked in the schedule.   Approved time off does not prevent you from scheduling an employee, but their name will be marked in red in the employee selector. If you assign a Shift to an employee during their time off, you will notice a red icon on that shift letting you know that you need to adjust the Schedule.   Additional settings Calculating day‚Äôs vacation in relation to weekday If you want a day's vacation to be calculated automatically in relation to a weekday, you'll need to specify the working hours per month in an employee's individual details (from  People  >  Employees  > edit employee >  Hrs per month ).    If your employee does not have a fixed requirement for working hours per month or if they are hourly paid, we recommend entering '1' and saving.  This also applies if the vacation should be deducted from PDF and Salary reports that you wish to generate.    In this case, the employee should have a value set both for Monthly salary and Hrs per month.    You can also set a Monthly salary and Hrs per month value of 1 if needed.   Need more help?

M Written by  Michael Tingey   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ   For admins and HR managers in the UK looking to set up leave. This changeover process is specifically for switching to the new  Calendar Week Method  for accruing UK leave, but the process will apply in other circumstances, such as changing from the old leave account module to the new leave module. üí°  Note:  Depending on the language setting on your profile, references to  Leave  below may appear as  Absence  in your Planday organisation. These terms both refer to the same thing in Planday.   Step 1: Create the new leave account template Create the new leave account template by navigating to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  >  Account Templates  and clicking the blue  Create  button.  Fill out the settings for the new template, referring to your old account template for guidance on what settings to use or read  How to set up accrued Absence accounts article . To use the new Calendar Week Method for accrual, use the following settings under Accrual policy and Shift types sections instead of your old settings.  In the  Accrual policy  section, select the following settings to use the new Calendar Week Method: Accrual rate:  Average working week (Calendar week method)   Monetary payout:  52 week reference period (Calendar week method)  for the default weekly earnings average, or hourly wage to use each individual employee‚Äôs hourly rate.   In the  Shift types  section, select the shift types that are to be considered working shifts and included in the calculation. A week with one or more shifts using any of the shift types selected here will count towards the calculation and accrue leave. Any week that consists exclusively of shift types that are not selected here will not be included in the calculation and will not accrue leave.    In the above example, the shift types  Normal ,  Meeting ,  Overtime ,  Salaried Overtime , and  Training  will all be included in the calculation and accrue leave. The shift types  Leave Without Pay, Off Sick, and Statutory Sick Pay  will not count towards the calculation and any week that exclusively has these shift types will be skipped entirely by the calculation.    Step 2: Create new leave accounts based on the new template created at step 1 Create the new leave accounts by navigating to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  and clicking the blue  Apply template  button.  Click Apply account template to multiple employees. Select the account template you created in step 1 from the Account name list and click Next.   In this screen you can limit who will get the new accounts by department or employee type in the Assign section if necessary. In the Start Date section, set this to Same start date for all employees and use the first day of your new leave year. All other settings have defaults that are pulled from the account template created at step 1 and can be left as they are.    Click Save. You will see a message pop up at the bottom of the screen advising how many accounts were just created.   Step 3: Transfer any future leave requests to the new accounts Planday will by default create two leave accounts for each employee, one for the current leave year and another for the next leave year to allow future leave requests to be submitted. Since we are changing over to new leave accounts, any leave requests submitted for next leave year against the old accounts will need to be denied and re-submitted against the new account created at step 2.  To assist this step and to have a record of these requests, export a report of leave requests for next leave year by navigating to  Schedule  >  Leave requests , then  Export  >  Leave report . In the new window:  Set the dates for the next leave year (e.g. 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024). Untick the  Denied  status. Tick  Show details  for a more detailed breakdown of each leave request, or leave it unticked to just see the date range of the requests. Click the green  Print Report  button and once it has loaded, click the  Download File  link that appears next to the Close link. This is your excel leave request report.   Re-enter, or have the employees re-enter, the future leave requests making sure to choose the new leave accounts created at step 2. You can do this by navigating to  Schedule  >  Leave requests , clicking the blue  Register leave button, and following the steps there.  Since you have the report of the leave requests you created earlier, you can now deny all leave requests for next leave year against the accounts we are changing from. This is a necessary step to delete the old accounts and avoid double accruing in both accounts.  Navigate to  Schedule  >  Leave requests . Set the Period start date to the first day of your next leave year (e.g. 1 April 2023). Set the status to show both  Pending  and  Approved requests .   Filter to the leave account we are changing from by clicking the  Filters  button and selecting the old account name in the Account names dropdown.    Once the above filters are set you now have a list of all approved or pending leave requests for next leave year against the account we are changing away from.  Open each leave request in this list and click the red  Deny  button. In the popup confirmation window untick  Send notification to the employee  and click the red  Deny  button again.   Step 4: Delete old Absence accounts Once all leave requests in the old accounts have been denied in step 3, we can proceed to delete those leave accounts which have been replaced for the next leave year. Navigate to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts Set the Period start date to the first day of your next leave year (e.g. 1 April 2023)   Click  Filters  and choose the old leave account name from the Account names dropdown. This is your list of all accounts for the next leave year from the old account template.   Hover over the first account and click the delete button on the far right. In the popup confirmation window, click the red  Delete  button. If successful, you will get a message at the bottom of the screen with a tick advising it has been successful. If you get an error here, it is likely there is still an approved or pending leave request for this account that needs to be denied.    Complete:  Once all of the above steps are complete, you have changed over from your old account template to the new account template in time for the new leave year.    Need more help?

Create leave Account templates Leave account templates that define the characteristics of a leave. This can be the duration of the leave, when the leave can be used, which employees or groups can utilize this leave and many other attributes. Leave accounts can be applied as  fixed Leave accounts  usually set up for permanent staff and  accrued Leave accounts  which are typically set up for hourly-paid staff who earn leave by working.    You can enhance your leave accounts by setting up  Bank holiday calendars , so national holidays don't count towards deducting your employee's leave balance.   2. Apply leave Account templates to employees Assign leave accounts to employees so they can utilise their given leave. As a manager, you can apply the leave accounts automatically to new employees or employee groups. You can also set up a leave template to automatically apply to all employees that match certain criteria. Or you can choose to  manually apply the leave accounts.   3. Employee requests leave After leave accounts have been assigned, the employee can  request time off via the Planday app  or through the web. As an admin, you can also  assign leave for employees on their behalf .   4. Approve, reject or edit requests After employees request leave, you can  accept, decline or edit the leave requests . It is not possible to delete a request for leave. However, as a manager, you have the option to amend the leave or reject it. It will always be in the history of rejected leave requests.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents Once you have created an Absence account under  Settings  >  Leave and overtime  >  Account templates  and assigned it to your employees, the start date can no longer be changed for everyone at once. As soon as the account is in use, it is ""locked"" in several areas, including the start date.  Change the absence start date for an individual employee If you need to change the start date for an individual employee, this can be done by going to  Employees  > select the employee >  Edit  > go to the  Leave overview  (or  Absence overview ) tab. You select the account in question and press to open it - or edit it via the pencil on the far right.   Here you can adjust the start date of the accruing period in the left box for ‚ÄúPeriod‚Äù. For employees hired later than the original start date, the start date should be the same as the employment date.   Note that the changes here affect  only   the   selected employee . You can also change the end date if desired. This may be relevant if, for example, the employee stops working and you don't wish their account to accrue further leave.  Change of start date on an Absence account via Absence accounts overview page You can also choose to change the start date on an Absence account via the Absence accounts overview page for an employee. Go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts ( or  Absence accounts) . Here you can use the search function, find the employee and tap anywhere on the line you want to edit.    Change of start date on an Absence accounts for multiple or all employees When you create an Absence Account, you can choose whether it should be renewed automatically. Most people choose this so that they do not have to worry about setting up a new absence account year after year. In this case, the system will automatically create a new Absence account so that there is an active and a future Absence account on the employee. As the consumption period is usually longer than the accrual period, employees may request leave from the next account where they still have vacation days from the old account.   Example: You have created an absence account valid 01/01/21 - 31/12/21 and a new account has been created with a validity of 01/01/22 - 31/12/22 automatically, based on the setting ""renew automatically"". The employee begins to request vacation from the latter vacation account in 2022. As an administrator and employee, you really want to spend the oldest holiday first, and therefore you can solve this by changing the accrual period and spending period. To change the start date of the year to 01/02/22, in addition to having to change the spending period for that original account, you must first: 1.  Export absence requests from 01/01/22 - 31/12/22 as backup Go to  Schedule  >  Absence requests ( or  Leave requests)  >  Export  >  Absence report ( or  Leave report)   You will then be given the option to specify which periods and Absence requests you want to see, depending on the status, absence account type and departments.   2.  Reject requests from 01/01/22 - 31/12/22. See  How to Approve or Decline absence requests from employees   3.  Delete all Absence accounts with the validity period 01/01/22 - 31/12/22 Unfortunately, you cannot delete several Absence accounts at once, so the only thing you can do is delete individually via  Schedule  >  Leave accounts ( or  Absence accounts)  and press the delete icon as shown below:   4.  Create the Absence Account with validity 01/02/22 - 31/01/23. Read more on  How to set up accrued Absence accounts   5.

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For advanced admins with full access to Planday. You first need to apply leave accounts to your employees. Go to  How to apply leave accounts to your employees  to find out how to do this. Do you want to see your employees‚Äô leave accounts to know which employees have a leave account and who‚Äôs missing one? This article explains how to view leave accounts on the Planday web. See an overview of your employees‚Äô leave accounts Once a leave account is applied to an employee, you can see it listed under the Leave accounts overview page under  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or  Absence accounts ) or in the  Employee profile  >  Leave overview tab . üí°  If a leave account is not visible, you will need to change the  time period  on this page as the overview only displays the accounts that are in the chosen period. It could also be because the account is inactive. In this view, there are four different key numbers: Start balance:  This shows the balance available at the beginning of the selected period Balance accrued:  This shows how many days/hours the employee has earned during the period selected. Balance used:  This shows how many days/hours the employee has used during the period selected. Available balance:  This shows how many days/hours the employee has available at the end of the period selected.   üí°  The system will not deduct unapproved holiday days/hours from the available balance.   These key numbers will vary according to the period you select in the filter. You can go to our  Absence & Vacation FAQs  to find out more about this. Set additional filters In addition, you can filter based on the following filtering options under  Filters : Departments , select which departments the list should contain Employee groups , select which employee groups the list should contain Employee types , select which employee types the list should contain Account names , select which account types you want to see in the list   Finally, you can also set  Account status  where you can choose which status of accounts you want to see between active, inactive, available or all. üí°  When an account is inactive, it can‚Äôt be used for accrual, and the employee cannot take leave from it.  You can also search for a specific employee if you do not want to fill in one or more of the filters. However, you can only search by first name and last name - not middle names.   How to make adjustments to leave balance You can also make adjustments to add or deduct the balance from an absence account by going to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  > edit an account > and pressing  Edit  in front of the balance.   This allows you to register a change of balance that will come into effect at a date of your choosing. A history of all adjustments to that account will also be visible on the account page.

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØFor Admins. This feature, formally called Planning metrics, is included from the  Pro Plan  and up. Reach out to our support team if you'd like to try it out. The  Data Center  formulas feature,   along with the  Data sets , is a smart scheduling tool that allows you to keep track of your planning needs.   In order to achieve that, you will need to start with the data aspect. Using  Data sets,  you can input what you want to keep track of and lay down the foundation for making smarter  Schedule  decisions.   How to create Data sets From the  Reports  >  Data Center  page, click on the  Data sets  tab.   On the  Data sets  page, you'll find the  Add data  button in the top right corner. This will open a window where you can enter an ID, a description, select a time unit, and how to handle the data in your set.   General : ID   The Data set ID can be used to reference the set you are creating in a Formula, and it must be unique for your organization. This is how the Planday will know which of your metrics should use which data.  You can only write an ID with uppercase letters and use an underscore as a separator (e.g: THIS_IS_AN_ID). For your convenience, the formatting is preset for you, where required.  When writing IDs, you should only use letters. Any numbers or other symbols might cause errors when used in Formula.  Later, by typing #YOUR_ID, you will be able to reference your data set. For instance, if you want to use it in a Formula.  You can find more about Formulas  here . Description The description of your data set can be used to briefly explain what data it contains and what the data means.  This will be visible on the Data sets overview list and can quickly communicate what it can be used for. With the general settings in place, you need to decide how detailed the data needs to be when entering it in the weekly input table.   Time unit & grouping:   Here, you will configure the rows and columns of your Data set input table. Please keep in mind that once your Data set is created it is  not  possible to modify its Schedule settings. If you need a different setup, you will need to create a new metric. Time unit Because your data sets can be shown in the Schedule as a formula, it's important to know what and how they are represented. That's what  Time   unit  types can be used for. Assigning a predefined unit type will ensure that you have all the necessary information, in your  schedule  overview. Selecting a time unit  will shape how much data needs to be entered, per day: Input data for each day : there will be only 1 data entry for each day (1 row for each day column). Input data for each hour : there will be a cell available for every hour of the day (in total, 24 rows for possible data entries, for each day column). You can enter the data from the  Data Center  >  Data sets  page in the table created for your metric or import it through a CSV file. There are more details about adding data, in the section below.   In the same view, you can set whether the data entered will apply to your entire Schedule, or whether they should be different per Department, Section or Position, by choosing to assign or apply your metric: globally : the data is visible from every department, and is not influenced by the Department, Position, or Section selected for your Schedule view. assign different values to individual departments : the data is visible from specific departments For example, if you choose to enter data for each hour and you want to have different values for each department, your metric will have as many different tables as you have departments.   In the example below, there are only two departments: Back of House and Front of House, and as you can see from the two pictures, the tables for both departments can be found under the same metric.   The two options for  assign/apply different values to individual sections within a department  and  assign/apply different values to individual positions within a department  work in a similar way.  If you choose one of those two options, you also need to specify the Department. Here's an example of how the table will look like for a Data set, for  input data for each day , with different values to individual positions within a Department. In this example, the  Kitchen  Department has two different Positions:  Lunch  and  Dinner .   Please note that It is not possible to create a data set that only applies to one Position or Section (if you have more than one, in a Department). However, you can enter values for only that one Position or Section in your Data set, and like that, the data will only be visible for that Position and Section.   Click ""Create"" to start entering values for your Data set.   Please note, that you can later edit the  Description , but not the  ID  or  Time unit & grouping  for your Data set. More details about editing and deleting metrics can be found in this  article .   Adding values to a Data set On the Data sets page, you can see a list with all the metrics you have already created. Simply select the metric you need from this list. The input table for your metric will appear in the tab for Data set, displaying one week at a time. Navigate to the week you need (from the arrows surrounding the date range).   Entering data Here, you can type in your data directly, for as many weeks as you need. Remember to click  Save  (top right corner button) for your data to be registered in Planday. If you input any data and then navigate somewhere else outside the metric without clicking on  Save , the data will need to be entered again.  The data you enter needs to be numerical (with 2 decimals max.). Also, keep in mind that all the cells that have no number entered will not be used by your metric (for instance, either in your schedule or in the formula metrics they might be referenced in). This means that adding the value 0 to a cell in your row/column will not give the same results as leaving the cell empty. Importing data (via CSV) Also in the top right corner, you can find a  CSV  button, that gives you the option to  Export  and  Import  data from a CSV file (a file that contains Comma-Separated Values). A CSV file is similar to a spreadsheet and can be opened and saved from both MS Excel and Google Sheets.   To make sure that your data is imported correctly, you can first  Export  a CSV file and use that as a template.   Using an extra file like this might also be useful if your metric data needs to be collected from different Departments or colleagues. Similarly, if you want to keep a record of the previously entered data, you Export a CSV file from any date range (past, current, or future).

This feature, formally called Planning metrics, is included from the  Pro Plan  and up. Reach out to our support team if you'd like to try it out. The  Data Center   formulas  feature,   along with the Data sets, is an intelligent scheduling tool allowing you to track your planning needs.   Formulas represent the Data Center feature that helps you shape your data with mathematical operations. While the concept is based on simple operations with elements and data available in your Planday, the result can be a complex custom metric tailored specifically for you and your organization.   Creating Formulas Formulas are very similar to Data sets when it comes to the way they are set up.   From  Reports  >  Data center  >  Formulas  >  Add formula , and follow the same first steps: give your formula an  ID : this is used to reference your metric in other formulas. Remember that an ID can only be written with uppercase letters and underscores (Planday will format your ID correctly where necessary). give your formula a  Description : used to briefly explain what data it contains and what the formula means. choose if the Formula should be  displayed in the Schedule The main difference between a  Data set  and a Formula is the option to display it as a metric in your schedule. In the same view, you can set whether the data entered will apply to your entire Schedule, or whether they should be different per Department, Section or Position, by choosing to assign or apply your metric: globally : the data is visible from every department, and is not influenced by the Department, Position, or Section selected for your schedule view. assign different values to individual departments : the data is visible from specific departments The two options for  assign/apply different values to individual sections within a department  and  assign/apply different values to individual positions within a department  work in a similar way.  If you choose one of those 2 options, you also need to specify the Department. More info about the basic elements of a metric can be found in the Data metrics  article . When assigning your metric, you'll need to keep in mind that the components for gathering Schedule data used in your formula will be affected by what you choose. Formula metrics can only calculate data for Sections and Positions in a department. If your formula will use actual values from your schedule data do not assign it globally or to a Department. Once you click  Done , you will find yourself on the advanced settings page for your  Formula . This is where you can set up mathematical operations with: data from your  schedule  (e.g assigned shift hours or the total number of assigned shifts) Your available metrics  (more details  here ) and/or other  Formulas . The top field is where you can create the formula for your metric. Please note, that you can only add and edit things in order: elements are always added at the end of the formula and editing always starts from the last element (or most recently added).   To create your formula, simply type or choose the components you need. Those can be: numeric values mathematical operators  from underneath the formula field  ""+"" for addition  ""-"" for subtraction ""*"" for multiplication ""/"" for division ""("" and "")"" to set the order of operations. your available metrics , which lists IDs for all the metrics you have created previously.  This highlights the importance of choosing intuitive and explanatory IDs for your metrics, as this is the only information displayed.  For instance, from the 4 available metrics in the example below, the #SHIFTS_NEEDED ID is well set. In contrast, the #PAYROLL_SUPPLEMENT ID is not indicative of what kind of data it brings which can be anything from the actual amount added to the payroll to a percentage and could be set per hour or per shift.  Having good IDs can save you a lot of time.   Schedule data , which provides a list of all the data that you can use. You can always find a component for Schedule data to make it match your operations and the other elements in your formula, with the many variations available. For instance, if want to create a formula between 2 metrics with data per hour, you should choose the Schedule element that contains the data you need, listed hourly. Understanding the schedule data available for Data Center formulas All the Schedule data components contain information about shifts, in different states, and from the different levels of your schedule. Here's the complete list: You can also hover on top of any component for actual values from your schedule to get a full explanation of what it will bring to your formula, as shown below:   Once you're familiar with the Schedule data available, you can also use the filters available to narrow down the list: Count : filters based on whether the data should be gathered as  Shift hour count  or as  Shift count . Data gathering level : allows you to choose whether the data should be grouped by  Department ,  Position,  or  Section . Shift status : makes the distinction between the data based on  Open , or  Assigned,  shifts. Data displayed : regardless of the data return type (how the data is collected and grouped), data can be displayed  Daily  or  Hourly. When no filter is applied ( None  is selected for all the filters), you will see the complete list. Similarly, when a filter is set to  None , it is simply not applied to your list.   As an example, the formula below has three parts: a component for actual values for Schedule data, that is gathering the total number of hours in assigned shifts, by Department, per hour the ""-"" operator a self-made metric that contains the total number of hours worked (e.g. approved from Punch Clock entries). This formula would then calculate the difference between the total number of assigned (shift) hours and the total number of actual worked hours, and show in the Schedule. This can be useful if the number of hours worked depends on how many customers you have at a given time. This way you can quickly spot the periods where you might have scheduled too many employees or too few.   You will need to make sure that the components you use and the settings you applied when assigning the metric to departments and/or positions/sections inside the Schedule will match, so your metric calculations will appear in your schedule and show what you expect.   Think of the  Assign  option as an indicator for where the results of the formula will be displayed. With that in mind, you have to make sure that your formula is displayed in a place that matches the contents of the formula. As a rule of thumb, formulas need to match the level of the lowest structural level contained in your metric. The order is  Global  ‚Üí  Department  ‚Üí  Section  ‚Üí  Position , following the  structure  used in Planday.   Once you've set up the formula, just click ""Save"", and your Formula is done.

Reach out to our support team if you'd like to try it out. If you haven't set up any Data Center metrics yet, check out this  article  to see which fits best. With your data sets and formulas set up, it's time to put them to work. You can have your formulas displayed in your schedule exactly where you need them to make informed and data-driven decisions. Viewing Data Center formulas in the schedule Data sets can be shown on the schedule as  Data Center formula  only when included in a  Formula , when referenced through its ID.   For that, you need to create a new metric: a Formula. Creating a Formula is very similar to a Data set, with the addition of a set of formula options. In the Formula field, you just need to type the ID for the metric you want to display (e.g #YOUR_ID) or tap on one of the IDs listed under your available metrics. On the Schedule page, the metric will be placed depending on the structure level it applies for. Also, the unit type you chose for your metric, will determine how it will look. Please note that if there is data missing from your metrics for an entire week (some cells in the input table are empty), then the metric will not be displayed at all for that week.   The simplest version of a Formula is the one that is used only to display a Data set in your schedule. Viewing Formula in Schedule Besides simple Data - business metrics, you can use Formula metrics to show the result of operations between different elements.   In order to display your Formula metric in the Schedule, this setting must be toggled on for your metric. If you're not sure about whether or not the setting is toggled on, you can check from  Schedule  >  View Settings > Data Center formulas  then find your metric in the list, on the left, and tap on the edit icon ‚úèÔ∏è. If the option is not visible on your screen, check out this  article  about editing metrics.   Once you toggle it on, your metric should automatically display on the Schedule view. Depending on the unit type and the time setting you chose when you set it up, your metric may appear like a histogram or numbers, for each day/hour.   Please keep in mind that Data Center formulas visibility in the Schedule is related to the permissions and security settings defined for your organization. For instance, if your data sets reference payroll data, you must be an  Admin  to view the Data Center formulas section. More details about the permission levels can be found  here .   To see and read your metric data correctly, you should take into account: whether your formula uses values that are unique to each position within a specific department. If so, you should make sure to read the formula results for positions in that department. The same formula might show incorrect values (or no values at all) in a different department or at a different level (e.g. section). whether your formula uses values that are global or unique to each department. If that is the case, you may want to include it in other Formula metrics that yield results unique for each position (within a specific department), so that the data carries more meaning and takes the context into account. whether a formula metric is included in another metric. In this case, you might want to show only the latter, to avoid confusion or duplicates on your Schedule. which structural level your metric contains data for.  As explained in the setup  guide  for Data Center Formulas, the rule of thumb is that formulas need to match the level of the lowest structural level contained in your business metric. The order is  Global  (or portal) ‚Üí  Department  ‚Üí  Section  ‚Üí  Position , following the  structure  used in Planday. The way your Data Center formulas are shown in your schedule may change depending on the date range view (Day, Week, or 2 weeks). Your metrics will not be visible in the Month view.   Lastly, if everything is set up correctly but you can't find your metrics in the Schedule, or they don't appear to be correct, you can read through our  FAQ article  to find possible solutions or you can contact our support team for assistance.

This feature, formally called Planning metrics, is included in the  Pro Plan  and up. Reach out to our support team if you'd like to try it out. Whether in retail, health care, or the hospitality industry, your schedule data can give useful insights into how your business is performing. However, it might be as evident how and what to use to get meaningful insights into how well and efficiently your business is performing.   Here's a list of examples for you to use as a starting point. track the staff you need : by inputting how many employees you need to have working per day in a Data set and compare that with the number of assigned shifts for the same day using a formula. Could be useful for cafes, restaurants, bars or pubs, health care facilities, hotels, logistics or security, fitness and leisure facilities, cinemas, amusement parks. track working hours : a Formula can help you compare the assigned shift hours with the hours tracked with Punch Clock (imported in a Data set). Could be useful for businesses that can be affected by spontaneous events like those offering logistics or security services. health care facilities or hotels. spot the most profitable times : a Formula can be used to calculate your profit through an operation that takes into account your sales revenue (imported in a Data set from a POS system, for example), your staff cost (could be calculated as the hourly multiplied with the number of hours from assigned shifts) and other costs (imported in a Data set from your bookkeeping records).  If your restaurant applies lunch or dinner deals or your bar hosts themed parties, a setup like this would highlight if the deals or parties are adding the value you expected. Schedule cost will be available soon, as a Schedule element, within Formulas.   Could be useful for cafes, restaurants, bars or pubs, health care facilities, hotels, logistics or security, fitness and leisure facilities, cinemas, and amusement parks. keep an eye on your ticket prices : if you set up a simple Planning metric that inspects ticket sales (imported in a Data set, for instance) against your payroll costs (which could be either calculated from the Schedule data in a Formula or imported in a Data set from your payroll tool), you can make sure that your tickets and deals are set at the optimal price point. Depending on your setup, you might be able to spot differences in ticket sales per day or per employee.  Could be useful for cinemas, amusement parks, larger bars or pubs. make sure that you are always prepared : if your business is highly influenced by unpredictable events (for instance, a sudden increase in the number of admissions at a health care facility), a simple Formula setup would be able to calculate how many employees you will need at work for the upcoming period based on your demand (imported in a Data set).  For instance, if every 6 new admissions at your facility would indicate that 2 more employees are needed in your Schedule.  This is a small variation to the demand planning scenario described in detail in this  article . Could be useful for health care facilities, hotels, logistics businesses.  It is very likely that none of the examples above describes something that fits your business or organization. You could still use them as a guideline for mapping out which data point would be useful for you. You can also take a look at our  step-by-step guide  for setting up Data Center formulas for shift planning (demand planning). If you have a specific metric or example you'd like to set up, you can always contact our  support team  for assistance.   Start by thinking of what data would be most valuable to know when you are assigning shifts or planning ahead. Then break it down into parts and see whether there is a way to gather the information you need. The only thing you would have to do is to assemble a combination of metrics ( Data sets  or  Formulas ) and Schedule elements containing that information and  show it in your Schedule,  so Planday can do the work for you.

My metrics are not showing anything for some of the days in my Schedule. Why? This could mean that there is no data to show for those days, which can be the result of empty cells in your Data set input table or a signal that your formula is not giving a mathematically correct result for every day. You should head over to your overview page (  Reports  >  Data Center  ), select the metric that's problematic, and try to find the missing data in its components.   If you are using a complex setup (extensive formula metrics referenced used in a joint formula metric ), you might want to toggle on the option to  Show this formula as an option to be displayed in Schedule  for some of them, to have a way to compare and follow how the data is transformed from one formula to another. Remember that you can always contact our  support team  for assistance. The numbers shown on my Schedule don't make sense. What's going on? Because the Formulas feature can host complicated operations, sometimes your metrics might not behave as expected. To understand what's going on, it might be useful to compare what you expected to happen versus what is actually happening. For instance, if you expect a metric to count a shift you just assigned as 1 but instead, the metric shows a bigger numerical difference, which might indicate that the metric is actually taking into account the number of hours in that shift, rather than the shift itself.  There are a few things you could check to find out what the problem is: if this is happening for a Data set, check what kind of input data your metric is set to (per day or per hour) if you use a Schedule data element in a formula, check whether the element is gathering the data you expect. Hover over the element in the list of actual Schedule data elements and see if that matches your expectations. if you use several mathematical operators in your formulas, check whether the priority of operations is correctly set (the operators follow the arithmetic order of operations, so make sure to use the ""("" and "")"" to mark which operation needs to be calculated first). You've checked everything and the metric results still don't look right? Reach out to our  support team  for assistance. I'm trying to import my data through a CSV file but I get an error. How do I fix it? When importing data from a file, Planday performs a series of checks to make sure that the information in the file is valid. When one of these checks fails, you will see an error: ""The ID in the file is invalid. You can find the correct ID in a newly exported CSV file.""  Every structural level in Planday has a unique ID, that is used throughout the system to reference your Departments, Positions, or Sections. This is very similar to the ID you have to choose for your metrics, the difference being that it is numerical.  The CSV needs to contain the ID for the Department, Position, or Section so that the system can put your data in the right place. When you export a CSV file from the metric you are working on, the first cell will contain the structural level ID.  If that gets accidentally deleted or modified, you simply export another CSV file and copy the ID into the one you want to use for importing. ""The same date cannot be in more than one column. Please correct this and try again"" When you created your Data set, your choice in the Schedule settings defined how the input table needs to look like. Regardless of whether you chose to input data for each day or for each hour, you cannot have the same date twice in your CSV file, much like you do not have the same date twice in your Schedule.  The CSV file should have each column representing a (unique) date, the same way your metric looks on the overview page. ""A shift start time cannot be in more than one row. Please correct this and try again""  or   ""A shift start time can only be set at the beginning of an hour (e.g. 10:00)"" In the same way you cannot have the same date twice in your schedule, you cannot have the same hour appear twice in your CSV file.  Each row of your CSV file would only represent the start of a new hour (e.g 10:00) to limit the number of rows possible to the maximum amount of hours in a day.  If in doubt, you can set up a template Data set to  Input data for each hour  and then use it to export a CSV with the correct hour per row formatting. ""Cannot import [an_entry_from_your_file] as a number. Please adjust it and try again"" All the entries in your CSV file (besides the first column and the first row) should be filled in with numerical values. If a cell contains any other type of data, the system cannot change that in the right shape (for instance, number of shifts needed).  At the same time, please keep in mind, that decimal points might interfere with the formatting of your numerical values, depending on the tool you use to edit/input data in the CSV file. ""Cannot import {0} as a date. Please adjust it and try again"" or ""Cannot import {0} as a shift start time. Please adjust it and try again,"" Date and hour formatting has many variations. Usually, this depends on where your organisation is operating (country) and your settings in Planday (Settings > Your organisation  > General). If you see either of the two errors above when trying to import a CSV file, you should check your hour and date entries to ensure they are consistent and do not contain any unusual characters. The easiest way to fix it would be to export an example CSV file and match the date/hour formatting.

Reach out to our support team if you'd like to try it out. Data Center sets and formulas can be used to ensure that the demands of your organization are met in a smart way. For instance, you can highlight how many shifts will be needed for the upcoming period or let your schedule managers know how many events/bookings are coming up.   Here's a step by step guide on how to use Data Center formulas for planning the number of shifts you need to cover the demanded workload.   Guide for demand planning Go to  Reports  >  Data center  >  Data sets  and choose  Add data . Give your data set a descriptive  ID , and add a  description . Select the time unit option that will allow you to  input data for each day  and choose to assign your metrics different values  to individual positions within a department .  Then choose the  Department  for which you need to plan shifts from the dropdown menu. Click  Done  and then create a Formula. You will need the Formula metric to display the demand numbers from the Data set you just created. Go to  Reports  >  Data Center  >  Formulas  and choose  Add formula . Give your formula a descriptive  ID , and add a  description . The ID for the Formula metric should be different than the ones set for the Data metric yet related. See an example below. Toggle  visibility in Schedule  on, so this formula will be visible in your schedule. Choose to assign your metrics different values  to individual positions within a department .  Then choose the  Department  for which you need to plan shifts from the dropdown menu. Make sure that the assignment settings and the Department for your Formula metric match your Data metric:  Assign different values to individual positions  and the same  Department  is selected from the dropdown menu. Click on  Done  to continue with the next steps. Create a formula that will show you the difference between how many shifts you have assigned on a given day versus how many shifts you need.  You can do this through a  formula  that  subtracts  (uses the '-' operator) the data from your  Data set  (created from the steps above) from the  Assigned shifts, by Position - Daily  Schedule element.  A very important detail to note is that the  Assigned shifts, by Position - Daily  element, will only count the assigned shifts from your schedule. This means that Shifts with any other status will be ignored (e.g. Open Shifts). On the  Data Center  >  Data sets  page, select the Data set you just created to start entering the Shift demand for your schedule Positions. You will need to repeat these steps for every  Department  you need to have a planning overview for.   Once you're done setting up the demand planning metrics for all your Departments, go to your schedule page where you will now see the metrics as daily numbers: a  negative number  means there are not enough assigned shifts to cover the demand. The number will indicate how many shifts you still need to assign. zero  means you have matched the demand, a positive number  means you have exceeded the demand. The number will indicate how many extra shifts you have scheduled for that day. Here's how it could look in the Schedule. The example uses a demand of two shifts for each of the three days. In the picture below: the first day has an extra shift, the second day still needs two shifts to be assigned the third day has two assigned shifts, which meets the demand for the day.  Notice that the Open shift is ignored by the demand planning metric.  Next: FAQ - Data Center Previous: Editing or deleting Data sets or Formulas Need more help?

What are Data Center formulas used for? Make data-driven decision for your Schedule Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago üéØ For Admins. This feature, formally called Planning metrics, is included from the  Pro Plan  and up. Reach out to our support team if you'd like to try it out. The  Data Center formulas  feature ,  along with the  Data sets , is a  Scheduling  tool that allows you to keep track of your planning needs. These metrics are meant to help you get one step closer to making data-driven decisions and give you an easy overview of your business needs, directly in Schedule (see an example below).   With this feature, you can keep your costs on track or be prepared for busy periods. For instance, you can use  Data Center formulas  to  display in Schedule : your scheduling needs : e.g. number of shifts needed for the upcoming period, productivity insights : e.g. sales revenue / employee/ hour schedule differences : e.g scheduled hours vs. worked hours cost & resources insights : e.g. eat-in orders vs. take-out orders, number of reservations vs. guest no shows. performance and strategy insights : e.g. event revenue vs. event cost. Because your needs can change very fast or be different from one part of your organization to another, the  Data Center formulas  feature is constructed to rely on the data that you input and the information recorded in your Schedule.   To see what it can do for you, start by heading over to the  Reports  >  Data Center . Get familiar with Data Center formulas using this setup guide for  Demand planning .   This will open the Data Center page where you can start creating the data sets and formulas you need. This is also where you will find an overview of your existing metrics later.   The  Data Center  element you choose determines where the data comes from. This gives you two ways to use data: as a  Data set , useful if your metrics need to use single-data inputs, per day or per hour. A  Data   set  should be used in Formulas if you need it to be visible in Schedule.  More info about the Data sets can be found in this  article .  as a  Formula , that gives you the opportunity to combine multiple metrics into one. Formulas can be set up using mathematical operations between your other Data sets and/or elements from your  Schedule  (actual values recorded on your portal).  More info about the Formulas can be found in this  article . Specifically, a Data set would require you (or your colleagues) to input or import what's needed. In contrast, a Formula could be based on a mix of data that needs to be filled in and data gathered from your schedule.   If you're in doubt about what kind of metric you should create, you can look through some of the commonly used data sets or formulas  here .

Here's what's new: Web:  Improvements to the Schedule page The schedule page received an update to improve the  visibility of bulk actions . Instead of icons, you now have buttons with text indicating the actions:  Edit ,  Approve ,  Set shifts to open , and  Delete .  When a Shift type does not allow for a break, the option to add a manual break to that shift has been removed from the schedule. This change clarifies what is sent to payroll regarding break data when marking shifts that do not require breaks. (For example, sickness, maternity or short shifts.) Improvements to the Schedule template editor It‚Äôs now possible to perform the following  bulk   actions on multiple shifts at once  in your templates: Edit shifts. Set shifts to open. Delete shifts.   Added the option to add comments to shifts in the Schedule template.  This means that schedule managers can prepare helpful information to go out to employees. Shift comments can now be added to the templates. Manager‚Äôs shift comments are copied when they save a schedule as a template. Lightened workload by not having to write comments on the shifts manually after applying the template.  Improved help messages when bulk-deleting shifts The confirmation messages are now updated to provide the exact information as to how many shifts out a total number of shifts were deleted and why some shifts could not be deleted. You now know which actions were taken and which could not be acted. Added option for notifying employees when deleting a whole week. Ability to change from Starter to Plus package You can now  change  your Planday subscription from a Starter to a Plus plan without waiting for processes to complete. If you are on a Starter package and want to upgrade, go to the Account section under your profile > switch to Plans > and press Upgrade under the Plus plan. Instantly access the Plus package's complete feature set, saving time and empowering you to  manage your plan changes  yourself. New payment method: ‚ÄúDirect debit‚Äù  will soon be available as a payment method for self-upgrade packages. This feature is being tested with customers in the UK and will be out to other markets soon. Edit carry-over settings on individual leave accounts (UK only) It is now possible to edit carry-over settings on individual Leave accounts (or Absence accounts) like on Leave templates. This setting is now available for admins in the UK and will be rolled out to other markets soon. Go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  > edit an account > and press  Edit  in front of the balance. This allows you to make the following changes to an employee's leave account: Enable/disable carry over. Edit the balance which can be carried over. Edit the date at which the carry-over balance expires. Time blocks added to the Data Center (Pro and Enterprise packages only) Addition of Time blocks option has been added to the Data Center. If the Data Centre is enabled, you can now create Metrics based on hourly data. Planday app:  Optimisations to shift request widget We changed the overview widget to show the count for up to three months‚Äô shift requests only, improving the app‚Äôs loading speed. The Shift requests data shown in the Requests screen is not affected by this improvement and will contain all the Shift requests.   Paid break information in Shift details  Employees can now see if their shift  break is paid or unpaid  from the Shift details page, giving them a better idea about the money they‚Äôll earn for the shift. This change is for both Android and iOS app. Optimised People feature for managers and employees is coming soon! To improve the user experience, we are introducing a UI change that enhances usability when browsing and editing employee information. We will move the  People  section under  More  >  Workplace  as part of this optimisation. Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 8.2.0 ) or iOS ( 8.2.0 ), updating to newer versions as they are released. Need more help?

Here's what's new: Web: Updated Edit salary form We have updated the form for  editing your employees‚Äô salaries  with a new design and minor improvements. The functionality is still the same as you are used to, but some things are moved around to make it more intuitive for you to use and provide a fresh look and better overview.   You can explore the changes by going to  People  >  Employees  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Edit salary .     Added support for  Salary periods Besides a monthly salary, we now support more salary periods. This will allow you to define the fixed salary amount the employee is entitled to get paid over a year, month, fortnight or week.   The Salary period is selected per employee and can be found under  People  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Edit salary .   For your employees with a fixed salary amount already set up, the Salary period will still be per month. This means that nothing changes in your current setup.     Added support for  Pay periods We are also introducing  Pay periods  for processing payroll, where you can select how often your employees get paid. The Pay periods that are supported are weekly, fortnightly, and monthly. This applies to both an hourly wage and a fixed salary.   From  People  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Pay periods , you can now select a Pay period for each employee.   The default Pay period is monthly, and this is preselected for all your employees unless you change it. When processing your payroll from  Payroll  >  Payroll export , you can select which Pay periods to include.     Paid breaks From  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Break rules , you can set up  Break rules  that will be added to the Schedule automatically. You can also add breaks manually on a shift-by-shift basis from the  Schedule .  We have now added the option to set a break as  Paid  when creating a new or editing an existing Break rule.   When adding a break directly to a shift in the Schedule, you can also select if the break is Unpaid or Paid.   Paid breaks will appear in reports the same as unpaid breaks, but the employee's wage will not be deducted during the break. Nothing changes in your current setup of breaks. The breaks you currently have are still set to unpaid unless you manually change the type.   App: Improved shift transactions and shift details We have improved the accessibility and layout when you request open shifts, swap or hand over with colleagues, and set your shifts for sale.  Additionally, the shift details now include the time and duration of breaks.   Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 8.1.2 ) or iOS ( 8.1.0 ).    Integrations & Open API: Personio (HR integration for the UK, France, Germany and Spain) With the Personio integration, you can import your employees and their leave data directly into Planday. The data can be imported manually, or you select to have it imported automatically once a day. This way, you will have the data where and when you need it. Read more about  How to connect Personio to Planday .   New Open API endpoints In an effort to extend our API coverage, we added support for endpoints related to the HR API and Absence API. HR API We are introducing a new  Employee Account Management  controller. Using this controller, you can control your employees' credentials and help them access their Planday accounts. Absence API We are introducing  Adjustments  endpoints. With this, you can read and create adjustments on accrued absence/leave accounts to update your employee‚Äôs balances.

Updated Pending Requests page We are constantly trying to improve our product and make easier for you to get the information you need faster. The new and improved Pending requests page will show you the current shift Swap requests, in which sorting order you would like. To make things simple, you, and your managers, can only see the departments you have access to.

From this view you can assign your employees directly. Any other changes to the shift, can be made from the Schedule view. Once you manage the request, the employee will be notified automatically, by default. Additionally, you can send them a text message, if that is setup and available for your portal. Check out the new pages in Schedule > Pending requests.   Added Shift Overview page Information is key in fast paced business, and we always work to make data readily available and tailor made for you. All the information about an employee regarding Shifts, Shift types, Department, Schedule > Position, Breaks, Payroll is compiled into the new Shift Overview.    The Shift Overview page can be set to display the period you need from the Date range, and you can switch between employees from the Employee dropdown menu, once the view is open. You should keep in mind that this overview takes into account the department restrictions set for you or your managers.

Restricted notifications and emails from being sent to deactivated employees. Fixed an issue that sometimes triggered an error message when editing or adding a position, in Schedule view. Payroll costs are now displayed correctly in Schedule view, for Positions, reflecting whether they ""Affect Revenue"" or not. Ensured that Payroll exports can include Monthly Salaries, for both ""All Shifts"" and ""Approved Shifts"", if needed. Removing breaks when editing a shift no longer blocks saving those changes on the Shift Restored Edit employee from Schedule > Employees view. Fixed an issue that prevented Overtime hours to be registered from respective Shifts, if created from a Schedule template.

This is in line with the Pending Requests page update (Schedule > Pending Requests), improving loading time and display accuracy. Ensured that the employee working status is visible, even when filtering is applied. If your filter selection, hides a shift from the schedule, this will be replaced with a working status.

With the revenue inside Planday managers can easily compare sales with scheduled cost to monitor performance.   Datal√∏n Integration (Payroll integration, for DK) From now on, it will be easier to export payroll data directly from Planday to DataL√∏n, through a new API integration. Using DataL√∏n for managing payroll, through Planday will allow you to create a connection of users between the two and make sure you are constantly up to date. The new integration also allows you to export the payroll data you need directly into DataL√∏n. See how to set it up on our support guide  page .     What's next?

This will display "" 12 hours ago""  for someone last seen online within the last 12 hours; "" 1 day ago "" - for someone last seen online between 12 and 24 hours ago, etc. Similarly, the  Created  column will show you the date when an employee was added to the Planday platform.   You can find this information in  People  >  Employees . If the columns are not already visible in the list, you can enable them if you click  Employee details,  select the field you want and click  Save .    Visual updates for Working time rules For Planday to do as much work for you as possible, things need to be easy to find and well explained. In an effort to achieve just that, the Working time rules page is getting a large visual update. The way the working time rules function for the  Schedule  has not changed, instead we made them easier set up and understand. You will start to see the result of this makeover in your portal in a few weeks time. In the same place as before, you can view, edit and create new Working time rules from  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Working time rules .       Upcoming changes to Employee form setup We're constantly making efforts to make your job easier, including maintaining employee records.  Very soon, you will notice a few changes to:     Gender field  - it is now possible to archive the field from an Employee form. This means that the field will be no longer required for an employee. Dropdown fields  - you will be able to create and adjust custom fields that offer multiple options, as a dropdown, without hassle or needing to contact our support team. You can see an example in the picture, to the right. Picture fields  - there is now a quick overview option, from the  Employees  overview. When you choose to display the Picture field, this will highlight whether there is a picture uploaded for each employee and give you quick access to the picture in question. Fixes and minor updates We removed the ""Refer & Earn"" from the profile menu  (top right corner on the web platform or under the Account tab on the mobile app), in preparation for upcoming changes. We encourage you to still be a Planday Ambassador and kindly ask you to contact our support team for next steps. Enabled ability to export Visma L√∏nn payroll without wages.  This can be configured from  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Manage the Visma integration , where you can toggle on/off including wages in the export. Mobile As announced last month, from Monday the 9th of March, you will notice     An updated  Login  page This step increases drastically the stability of the app and adds support for Single Sign-On with select identity providers. The authentication process has been redone to improve not only its stability and performance, but also to make it easier and friendlier for you to use. This includes keeping you logged in for a longer period and preventing being kicked out of the app. Single Sign-On is system that allows users to use a single set of login credentials in more than one place. This frees up time and reduces hassle on the long run, as your employees will be able to login faster and know more about how their information is used. This update also includes a visual-only update for login flow for web platform.    A big ""Thank you!"" to all of you who offered to try out and tested this feature before release. It was of huge help to make sure that switching to the new and improved login system is as smooth as possible, for everyone. Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android (6.2.1) or iOS (6.1.0).   Android - version 6.2.1 This version brings translation updates for  Punch Clock  messages and the  Employee  section (for creating or editing an employee entry). As we're constantly working on improving performance, we boosted the  People  section and fixed a few application issues, among which:        Schedule duration shown on the last week of year will now be displayed correctly The blue dot notification in  Availability , when you have a shift, was restored to its normal behavior. We ensured that the checkmark in Edit profile appears correctly The  chat  button should now be always available, even after the first time you login. We removed the redundant ‚ÄúAdd Photo‚Äù function when creating/editing an employee We ensured that editing your profile, when you first login, is fully supported and smooth.     iOS - version 6.1.0 The update for this version focused on stabilizing the application, so that it works as you expect it. This includes:     A fix for an issue that was causing an application crash when selecting the displayed month in  Your shifts The blue dot notification in  Availability , when you have a shift, was restored to its normal behavior. We ensured that  Shift requests  display the complete and correct information, including who requested the shift and what time the request was made. The  Punch Clock  icon is now displayed in the correct color.  The efforts for the upcoming month will concentrate on performance and stability.  Did this answer your question? üòû üòê üòÉ"

We wish that 2021 will be a better year for everyone!   To kick it off, here's what we've already released for you, so far: For web : Improved  security group  management Improved support for  Skills  in  Schedule filters Updates for management of  Accrued vacation  accounts (UK & DK only) Improved security for  statistics reports , aligning with Department access restrictions Updates for file format exports, for  Sage50   (details below) For the Planday app : Automatic  detection against   rooted  (Android) or  jailbroken  devices (iOS) Progress towards completing the  Messaging  update (details after the Web section) Web Improved  security group  management To support hierarchical structures for organizations, with manager roles on different levels, we've improved the way you can manage Department access permissions in Planday. Previously, any manager with edit rights for Department access permissions within a security group could change or edit Department access for all members of said security group, independent of hierarchy or security group ranking. You can read more about permissions in this  article .   With this update, managers will need a permission level equal to or higher than that of their employees or other managers within a given group, to be able to modify Department access for them. If you're in doubt about the hierarchy of permission levels or want to make sure that it aligns with the structure within your organization, please reach out to our support team (from the chat icon, in the bottom right corner). As a reminder, with the right Permission level, you can edit or grant Department access from  People  >  Employees  > open  Quick-edit  view for the Employee you want to edit Permissions for, by clicking on their name on the list. In the quick-edit view, where you'll find a Permission section. Here, you can add or edit existing permissions for that employee.   Improved support for  Skills  in  Schedule filters If your organization is using the Skills feature, scheduling for a particular skill just got a little faster. You can read more about Skills in this  article .   To make it easier for you and your Schedule managers to get a clear overview of your employees with a specific skill and of the scheduled shifts requiring a specific skill, you can simply toggle on the skills you're looking for, in the Skills section of your Schedule Filters. As a reminder, the Filters can be found on your Schedule page, in the top left corner (available for all views).   Through the  Skills  filter, you also choose whether to show both  shifts and employees with the selected skills  or  only employees with selected skills (and all their shifts) .   Updates for management of  Accrued vacation  accounts (UK & DK only) This month brings another series of updates to the Accrued vacation feature, part of the Vacation module, including:   1. added support for  History Log  on  Absence requests The new history log will show a list of all the changes made to a vacation request from the moment it was created. Every entry will have information about who made the change, when, what the change was (whether it was approved, denied, or simply edited), and the message attached to the change (if any).   2. added support for defining requirements for calculating vacation accruals. You can now choose whether the accrual within Accrued Vacation accounts takes into account a certain number of worked & approved Shifts for your employees, or whether the accrual happens automatically regardless of that employee's Shifts. Please note that the option to configure the accrual requirements is available for accounts that do  not  rely on a percentage based accruing rate.   This can be particularly useful for organizations that have salaried employees on staff and don't use Shifts within the Schedule. You can edit your existing Accrued vacation accounts or create new ones with specified requirements from  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation .   3. added support for  Supervisor  filter on the requests page The  Absence Requests  page now has an additional filter, to help you find and handle requests faster. The latest addition to the filter list allows you to show the requests from employees with a particular Supervisor.   If you not already using the Supervisor feature for your staff, but would find it useful, know that you can find it and set it under  People  >  Employee  >  Edit Employee details , at the bottom of the Details tab (if it's not visible to you, it might be because it needs to be configured first, from  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup  or because you might not have the right permission for this). Please keep in mind that you can always reach out to our support team for assistance (from the chat icon in the bottom right corner of the page).   4. improved  Carryover  functionality   The functionality embedded in the Accrued Vacation accounts for the carryover of unspent vacation balance, is now automated. This update will save you time by automatically creating an appropriate account, and setting the balance and the spending period end date for the employees who have  any vacation balance left, at the end of the vacation year.   Improved security for  statistics reports , aligning with Department access restrictions In order to maintain consistency across Planday, in terms of Department restrictions, Schedule statistics and Shift type statistics reports will now reflect the restrictions of the user generating them. You can read more about  reporting  in Planday, in this  article .   This means that admins or managers who can view only a limited number of departments, will also only be able to generate reports for employees within the departments they manage. Please note that the department restriction is applied when gathering data for employees, not shifts. This means that, if an employee has Shifts within multiple departments, the report will contain all the shifts for that employee, including the ones from the otherwise restricted departments. It is also important to note that after this change, deactivated employees will also be excluded from the restricted reports, as they no longer belong to any departments. Only a manager or admin with all-department access will be able to generate reports that include deactivated employees. Updates for file format exports for  Sage50 We've recently added the Sage50 employee export format to the employee export feature. This allows you to configure and enable a Sage50 employee export template and save reports, as needed, from  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Export data . To use this format, you'll need to enable and configure them in the Sage50 Integration editor, from  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  >  Sage50 , using this step by step  guide , to make sure that everything will run smoothly.   Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 6.14.0 ) or iOS ( 6.14.0 ).   The most recent update for the Planday app brings you: Automatic  detection against rooted  (Android) or  jailbroken  devices (iOS) In order to ensure that your data remains secure if your device is stolen or if someone gains unwanted access to it, we've added a safeguard to detect this kind of activity.  If a device has been Jailbroken (iOS term) or Rooted (Android term), the Planday app will lock and automatically close. This means that it will not allow access to the app or the sensitive information stored on your Planday account. progress towards completing the  Messaging  update As mentioned last month, the Messaging section of the Planday app is being updated gradually, by country. The update will also include support for receiving and sending attachments.  Time off , under your  Account , will now correctly align with the features used by your organization.  This means, that if you don't use or request Vacation within Planday, then the option will no longer be shown in your app. Did this answer your question? üòû üòê üòÉ"

While you were enjoying some well-deserved relaxation time, we wrapped up new features for you to be well prepared to jump right back into working smarter, not harder.   Web Added the option to make  Custom text fields , from Employee details, visible in  Schedule Information is most valuable if provided to you where you need it. When scheduling your employees, details like license plates, t-shirt size, phone number, or email address might influence our decisions. Or maybe you'd just like more information to be readily available on the Schedule.  Custom fields  for the Employee form setup you can now be used to show the information you need in your Schedule, as text, through Text fields or Related fields.  Simply create a new  Text field  for the information you want to show in  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup . Then navigate to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  General  >  Names on the Schedule , find the Department you need, and then tap the edit ‚úèÔ∏èfrom the right side of the new field you just created inside the display box. You will see all the text fields available in the Fields section to the left.      The  Custom text field  will be visible in the  Employees view , for the  Schedule  for the Department you chose to add it to.  You should keep in mind that creating and editing  Custom fields  is restricted through  access levels  (Security groups). and that you can always reach out to our  support team  for assistance if you need to.   Improved the management of  Employee Overview  list Sometimes speed is key when accessing information, which is why we've made 2 additions to the Employee Overview list:  ‚Üí you can now  quickly search  for an employee using their  Tax ID . This expands the search options for your employee list to First or Last name, Email address, Salary identifier, and Tax ID.  ‚Üí you can add show  true/false  (yes/no)  Custom fields  in your employee list, which can be particularly useful if you need to have a quick overview of which of your employees has a driver's license (or owns a car or has a particular certification), for instance.  If you need to add a new true/false field you can follow this quick  guide . Here's an example of how it could look like in the overview list, from  People  >  Employees .  Added a  View only  for  Employee Details When your HR managers need access to information from an employee's profile, they go to People > Employees > find the employee in question and tap the edit icon (‚úèÔ∏è).  Previously, if a manager has the right access  permission  they could see and/or edit the information on an employee's profile. At times, this could lead to accidental changes and end up causing headaches for that employee, until fixed. The new  View-only permission  for HR managers will help minimize the risk of information getting lost or changed by accident.  This would also give you the opportunity to have a new Security group for HR managers that can view, but not manipulate employee data.  If this is a feature you would like to use, please contact our  support team  to have it enabled. Added support for  Greek  üá¨üá∑ Planday is now also available in Greek.  As a reminder, you change the language settings for your profile menu: ‚Üí on the web client, you can  Edit  your profile settings from the top right corner menu. Then simply select your preferred language and click Save. ‚Üí Similarly, on the mobile app, you can change your language settings from  Account  >  Settings & Privacy  >  Settings  >  Language .   From 12.08.2020:  Adding support for  Accrued Vacation  for Denmark-based customers. (DK only) With September fast approaching and the new Danish Holiday Act taking effect soon, the Accrued Vacation extension to how Vacation is managed in Planday will become available for danish customers.  As a reminder, the new Danish Holiday Act will mean that your employees will earn vacation days, based on how much they work (within and accrual period of 12 months) and can take vacation days based on what they've earned (within and spending period of 16 months).  You can create new vacation accounts to automatically add up the vacation days earned by your employees and easily manage their vacation requests. Go to  Settings  >  Absence ,  Vacation, Overtime  to set up an accrued vacation account to be ready for September.     Increased stability for  Messaging  in  Network   portals You can rely on Planday's Messaging in Network portals to reach the relevant employees and managers, as you would on a stand-alone portal. This side of the  Messaging  feature has now increased stability and benefits from performance improvements.  You can read more about how to use the Messaging feature in Planday, in this  article . iZettle GO integration You can now import your  iZettle Go  data from the light version of the POS (point of sale) system to Planday.

Please Note: This feature will be available soon for Germany, Canada, Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Switzerland. Please check back this page for updates.

Let's dive right in:   System Calendar update for  Bank Holiday Calendar The Planday System Holiday Calendar has been updated with the upcoming Bank Holidays, spanning now until 2025.  To update the calendar on your portal, you'll need to add the new days to your own calendar, from  Settings  >  Portal settings > Bank Holiday calendar .  Here, you can either extend the calendar you currently use until the 31st of December 2025 or add a new calendar starting on the 1st of January 2021 and ending on 31st of December 2025).  Then simply import the Holiday calendar dates from the System calendar from the  Add  button on the right side. Select the available calendar (2021-2025) to copy from and set the date from the 1st of January 2021, then click Add. As a reminder, the Bank Holidays can be shown in your Schedule ( from  Schedule  >  Views  >  Bank holidays/Vacations ) and can be useful when calculating vacation request costs.  You can read more about Holiday Calendars and set one up, in this  article . Added  Shift overview  in  Schedule You can now get a broad overview of your schedule, with the new  Shift status overview  page that will gather information about all your shifts. This can be useful, if you need to get a quick picture of how your Schedule looks like on a daily basis, for a particular department.  You can filter the view to display either one of the available shift statuses (open, assigned, for sale, and approved), for your selected Departments. You can also switch between scheduled weeks, on the same page.  Please note that the visibility of Shifts on the overview page requires the same permission levels as Shifts in Schedule or Department information ( learn more about permissions ).  The overview page can be found in  Schedule  >  Tools  >  Shift overview. Improved  Manual Payroll supplements  to be  Affected by   Breaks  correctly Until recently, Breaks were not considered in calculating Manual Payroll supplements, even if the ""Affected by Breaks"" setting was enabled. This means that Breaks were not correctly deducted from the supplement, which could have lead to incorrect costs for payroll. This issue has now been fixed, and the Manual Payroll supplement page will reflect the accurate behavior.  This means that the recent update will correctly show the  Affected by Breaks  setting disabled, for your Manual Payroll Supplements.  In order to enable it, simply edit your supplement settings from  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll Supplements  > and find the edit icon (‚úèÔ∏è) for your Manual supplement, in its section.  Please make sure to specify a correct date range and payment period, to avoid payroll inconsistencies (read more about Payroll supplements in this  article ).

Improved  Vacation management  with more functionality, including updates to vacation requests and leave pay.  ( Currently available only in Denmark) Vacation management in Planday has been gradually improved over the last few months, a process that continues this month with:   1. added support for free input field for accruing rate, when setting up an Accrued vacation account The accruing rate setting changed from a series of preset options in a dropdown menu to a free input field, to accommodate custom configurations and avoid confusion. You can now type in the rate you need, with up to 4 decimal points. Read more about how to set up Accrued vacation accounts and commonly used percentage rates, in this  article .  2. Added support for requesting vacation on behalf of an employee & requesting vacation from web In some cases, you might need to create a vacation request on behalf of an employee and with the new update, you can do so in 2 ways:  - either from  People  >  Employees  > select the employee >  Edit employee  (‚úèÔ∏è) >  Vacation  >  + Add ; - or from  Schedule  >  Absence   requests  >  Request vacation  > select the employee.  and follow the necessary for requesting vacation.  More details about how to request  can be found in this article .  Once you've created the vacation request, remember to Approve it so your records are accurate.  You can find the vacation request later, under  Schedule  >  Absence requests,  if you need to.  At the same time, your employees can also request vacation from the web platform when they need to. In a similar way, they would apply for Time off through the app, your employees can do so from  Home  >  Your vacation  >  Request vacation .  3. Support for editing vacation requests Whether you need to modify an already approved or denied a vacation request from an employee or just need to change some details, you now have full control when managing vacation requests.  To edit requests, navigate to  Schedule  >  Absence requests  > find the request you need and tap on the edit icon on the right (‚úèÔ∏è).  Please note that while you can edit past vacation requests, this is limited to a maximum of 1 month back, to avoid payroll inconsistencies.   4. updated Schedule > Absence requests page The list of Absence requests can grow large very fast and that can make it inconvenient to search through. We've added more filters to help you narrow down your search: by Date range by Request status by Department by Employee group by Employee type by Employees or by Absence account name 5. Monetary value and vacation balance now shown when editing an employee's  Absence  account A monetary estimate of the vacation balance an employee has left on their Absence account (or has accrued to date) can be found on an employee's assigned Vacation account, under  Schedule  >  Absence accounts.  This estimate is calculated based on your set configuration for Vacation Earnings, on the Absence account template.  You can see and edit this from  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  > Edit (‚úèÔ∏è) for that Absence account.  The blue line on the Absence account highlights both the monetary estimate of the vacation balance and the vacation balance available to date, as additional information.  6.Reports for Vacation requests and Overtime requests Exporting requests report is once again available, in the formats you are already familiar with.  To pull a vacation request report or overtime request report, simply navigate to  Schedule  >  Absence   requests  >  Export  in the top right corner and pick the report you want.  7. Calendar view for Absence requests page You can get a better overview of the approved, denied and upcoming requests in a brand new calendar view ( from the dropdown menu in the top right corner, under  Schedule  >  Absence requests ).  The calendar view can be filtered like the List view, and requires a date range to be set, showing full weeks from the start to the end date you selected. The status of a request is color-coded and each request can be opened directly from the calendar.  Improved Hogia Integration with updated file format support Hogia  offers a Payroll solution, and as an ongoing partnership with  Planday , the Hogia required  Personal and employment data  file format is now available.

This month's release notes include:   For web: New look for your  login page , with an added  cookie policy  banner Improved performance for  lists , through  pages Accrued vacation  account management updates, including notification improvements and new filter options (DK only) Added support to restrict Managers from approving their own entries (details below) For the Planday app: embedded access to the Help Center with guides for using the Planday app Coming soon:  Messages  updates (details after the Web section)   Web New look for your  login page , with an added  cookie policy  banner The login page gets another fresh look this year to include a Cookies acceptance policy and to bring you a simpler, faster, and more accessible way to get your day started in Planday. The cookies acceptance policy is part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance and to be transparent about data usage.   The cookie policy banner includes a link where you can learn more about what cookies are needed and used for, also available here. Every 3 months, the same banner will appear on your login screen, so you can review the policy on a regular basis. Once you click OK, you'll be able to log in as usual.   Improved performance for  lists , through  pages Starting with the Employees list, we're adding an element of pagination to the way lists are handled in Planday. This means that lists will now load faster and will be divided into pages, of a max. 40 entries / page.   This is already in place for your list of employees, under  People  >  Employees , where you can browse through the list's pages from the top right corner of the list. The way you can filter the list is unchanged, with the exception of the fact that you can now see how many entries in your list fit with your selected filters. When no filters are selected, the number represents the total number of entries on the list ( that can be shown, considering the visibility settings in place for your organization )   This will soon be in place for the  People  >  Departments  list and  People  >  Employee groups  list, as well.   Updates for an improved management of  Accrued vacation  accounts (DK only) This month brings another series of updates to the Accrued vacation feature, part of the Vacation module, including:   1. Improved support for Notifications for vacation requests This update ensures that you will be notified as soon as one of your employees sends a vacation request and, in turn, that they will know right away whether their request has been approved or denied.   The notifications arrive in your message Inbox and can be read from both the Planday app and the web client. Depending on the response to your request, the message will contain a note from the approving manager and a balance update (when the request is approved)  Here's an example of the message from an approved vacation request notification:   2. Support for filtering vacation accounts based on availability In your Absence accounts overview list, from  Schedule  >  Absence accounts , you can now filter out the Absence accounts that do not have an active spending period. This means that through the  Active  filter, the list will only show you the Absence accounts that your employees can request vacation from (within the account balance requirements set for your organization).   3. Added ""Valid from"" & ""Valid until"" columns for the  Absence  accounts list   Under  Schedule  >  Absence accounts  you can find the list of Absence accounts assigned to your employees. This overview list will now also show you information about the validity period of a given account, including both the accruing period and the spending period (if they differ).   For instance, the  Valid from  column can help you sort the list based on accounts that are currently in use or accounts that will become active at a later point (but from which employees can still request vacation, to fit with their future plans).   4. Added a Do not use option for Vacation earnings When setting up template Absence accounts (or editing an existing one), you can now simply choose the  Do not use  option if no payout should be attached to an employee's vacation. This replaces the necessity to set a fixed rate of 0, for Vacation earnings to be ignored.   As a reminder, Vacation earnings are part of the account configuration from  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types  >  Accrued vacation .   5. Support for turning off automatic renewal for  Absence  accounts. You can now choose whether an Absence account should renew automatically or simply become inactive after the spending period is over. For example, this can be useful for account templates used for seasonal/temporary employees or used for transition periods that arise due to changes in regulation.   To configure this, you'll need to do so on the account template from  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types  where you can choose to edit an existing account or create a new one. The option to toggle off  Renew automatically  will be available in both cases.   Added support to restrict Manager permissions from approving their own entries By default, users with Admin and Schedule manager permission levels were able to approve Shifts and Punch clock entries, which included their own (whenever the case). With this update, this behavior will be restricted and no longer set as default. Please note, this update will not affect existing configurations made to accommodate this behavior.   This means that this will remain unchanged if the current setup for your organization allows your managers to approve their own entries.   When the restriction is in place, managers will no longer be able to approve their own entries as they will not be shown in the list of entries pending approval, both on the Planday app or through the web client.   If this is something that you find necessary for your organization and it's not already enabled, please reach out to our  support team  (from the messenger icon in the bottom right corner) for assistance.   Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 6.12.0 ) or iOS ( 6.12.0 ). The most recent update for the Planday app brings you: embedded access to the updated Help Center with guides for the Planday app, from  Account  >  Help Centre Coming soon:  Messages  update   With the next version of the app, you might notice a few changes in the Messages part of the Planday app. The upcoming changes add stability and performance improvements to messaging while aligning the messaging options available through the app with those already existing through the web client. This update includes the addition of: -  Required reply : which allows the sender to highlight the importance of their message and request an answer. -  Opened/Not opened : messages sent to multiple receivers will allow the sender to see whether their message has been read by everyone on the list or not. -  Reply all:  allowing group and thread messaging -  Attachments : of Photos or Files (of max. 50Mb combined) -  Forward : which allows the sender to redistribute a message, including the original attachments, when necessary. The changes for Messages are expected to be gradually released starting with Android version 6.13.0 and iOS version 6.13.0.     Android -  version 6.12.0 fixed an issue that prevented the bottom menu bar from being displayed correctly in some cases, on Samsung Galaxy devices. iOS -  version 6.12.0 fixed an issue that prevented Punch Clock from behaving correctly, without refresh, after a fresh install ensured that the app is displayed correctly on all screen sizes, after updating to iOS 14.   Kiosk for iPad Make sure to use the latest version available for iPad Kiosk App ( 1.4.0 )     Lastly, we'd like to wish you a perfect holiday season, be it quiet and relaxing or busy and profitable.   In the hopes that 2021 will be a better year, we wish you ""Happy holidays and A happy new year!"" Did this answer your question? üòû üòê üòÉ"

Improvement in Absence account templates From  Settings  >  Absence (Leave), Overtime, Vacation  >  Account templates , you can manage your templates for Absence accounts. As an improvement to these Account templates, we have added the option to select a  default Shift type for overlapping shifts  for each Account template.   This will ensure that the selected default Shift type will be pre-filled as the Shift type that should apply to any shifts occurring during the period your employees request absence. You can still edit the Shift type for overlapping shifts in each Absence request if needed.

You can switch to dual columns using the icons at the top right corner.   Employee type  and  Edit salary  have been moved to the  Employment  tab Renaming  in the  Edit salary  setup As mentioned in a previous edition of our Release notes, we were going to rename Monthly salary to Salary soon. This update is now done along with a few extra small updates ( text only ): Monthly salary  has been renamed  Salary. Salary is used to set a fixed amount of money paid to the employee (default period: month) The  Contracted hours  field is now called  Working hours . The field is used to calculate the expected cost shown in the Schedule. The  Salary  field is now called  Salary amount . These updates brought no changes to the functionality, it's only the text that has been updated. The default period for the Salary is still monthly, so nothing has changed in your current setup.   The new Edit employee form is being updated gradually for Planday platforms in all countries, so if you don't see the new design yet, you can look forward to exploring it soon.

As we adjust to the new normal, here's a a few things we've developed to empower you to work smarter, not harder:    Web Replaced  Change report  with  Schedule history For each of your departments, you will be able to follow schedule changes, directly in the schedule view. Previously, you could find information about schedule changes, under  Tools  >  Change Report . Please note that this is now called  Schedule History . The history shows recent changes and it will allow you quick access a Shift directly. You can find the new  Schedule history  under  Tools  on your  Schedule  view. Made it easy to organize fields and sections in  Employee form setup From now on, you can fully customize the Employee form, as you need to. Rearranging sections or fields by drag&drop, wraps up the work we've done on empowering you to structure your employee information. As a quick reminder, we've recently added support for adding Dropdown menus, Picture fields and the ability to relate text fields to dropdown menu options, so that informations is readily available. You now have a complete toolbox to organize the form as you want  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup >   Manage order,  from the top right corner. Added support for custom  Breaks  in schedule  Templates Schedule  Templates  now support manually created  Breaks , so you don't need to re-add them anymore. To make sure that those Breaks follow your schedule Template, you will need to create them directly in the template . Afterwards, when you apply the template to a new week, the breaks will automatically be generated for the shifts in your schedule. Please keep in mind that saving an already existing schedule with custom breaks as a template, will not save the breaks in the template. In that case, in order to make sure that the breaks are included in your template, they will need to be created in through  Edit template  from the Template menu. Integrations & API Updated the  Datev Lodas  integration to support cost center and cost unit Customers using Cost Centre and Cost Units will now be able to use the Datev Lodas payroll file to export payroll data, using a single file in Datev Lodas for all Cost Centers and Units. If you use Datev Lodas and would benefit from this update, make sure that  Departments  are setup as Cost Centers and that elements using  Salary Code 2  are setup as Cost Units. If you'd like to use this feature but don't have support for  Salary Code 2  enabled, please  contact our support team   for assistance.  From the Integration's settings, you can select to  Include Cost Centre and Cost Units . Generating a report from  Payroll  >  Export payroll  will then include the information selected.   Added  Portal API  for Planday Open API The new API enables partners and customers to get basic information about a portal, with a single API call. This is especially useful when building integrations meant for connected portals (network portals). The API call will return: Portal name, Company name and url/aliases Country and time zone Information about all child portals in the network (if made through a master portal) Added  Pay API  for Planday Open API The Pay API enables you to improve synchronization between Planday and other systems, when it comes to employee pay data. This allows you to read, set, update and delete employee pay rates and monthly salaries via the open API, which could also improve or automate the process of creating users and uploading employee data. The new pay API supports management of allocation methods, in relation to schedule costs, for employees with a monthly salary. Please note, that the Pay API requires permission to access data. Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 6.4.0 ) or iOS ( 6.3.0 ). Enabled  Punch Clock approval  through the app for more countries. Managers will be able to approve Punch Clock entries and manage working hours on the go, directly from the Planday app. The entries that need your attention will be in Requests > Punch Clock. The Punch Clock approval feature will be available for both iOS and Android, shortly.   Fixes : Ensured that a break has a minimum length of 2 minutes Fixed an issue that prevented Employees from uploading images in the necessary fields within the app. Android - version 6.4.0 Fixed an app crash that was caused by a third-party incident (from Google Maps) Employee Sections are now visible in the Schedule employee view Ensured that the Send message button works as intended iOS - version 6.3.0 Ensured that your choice regarding  Settings  >  Email Notification  is recorded properly. Fixed an issue that prevented Employees‚Äô names from being displayed properly in schedule Ensured that everything related to a deleted event is removed from the Event page.

Soon, you'll be able to find the  Data Center  under  Reports , along with  Planning metrics ,  Data sets,  and  Formulas .   One of the key parts of this new feature is the ability to get an overview of your business needs, directly in Schedule. With  Planning metrics , you will be able to gather in  Schedule , all the information you need to make better scheduling decisions. Get ready and learn more about the  Data center  and what it can do for you on our  help center .   The  Data center  feature will be available for the  Pro  and  Enterprise  plans. Remember that you can always reach out to our support team (chat icon, in the bottom right corner) if you have any questions or need assistance.   Improved support for  Absence accounts  (DK only) Added support for  Bank Holiday Calendar  in  Absence   account   types.  Under  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types  >   edit  Account type,  you can make sure that the  Bank Holiday Calendar  is taken into account for the absence accounts set up for your employees. Connecting the  Bank Holiday Calendar  directly to an Absence account template will help you save time when managing Absence accounts for your employees and will keep track of their account balances more accurately. Improved loading time for  Absence accounts  overview list, through pages. Under  Schedule  >  Absence accounts , you can now browse through the account list one page at a time.  Each page contains up to 40 Absence accounts entries, and you can navigate through the list using the arrows in the upper right corner.  This improves loading time and the performance efforts started with the  Department  and  Employee groups  lists.    Added support to create  Cover shifts  when   approving an  Absence request Some of your employees' absence requests might overlap with scheduled Shifts in your   schedule.  If that happens, you will now have the option to create  Cover shifts ., directly from the request, under  Schedule  >  Absence requests ,  This adds one more option to the list of possibilities when approving an absence request:  - Delete the overlapping Shifts - Keep the Shifts, but change their Shift type - decide whether or not your Scheduled needs to be covered for those overlapping Shifts.  If you need the Shifts to be covered, you can do so by creating copies of the Shifts conflicting with the Absence request and automatically set them to Open.  The newly create Open shifts will be set to the same Employee group/Position as the original Shifts.  With Cover shifts, you will be able to fill your scheduling needs much faster and with more flexibility, even when your employees take time off.  The absence request shown in the image below is from May 10th to May 14th and overlaps with 4 assigned Shifts. When approving this request, choosing to create Cover shifts, will create Open shifts for the same group, within the same parameters as the original Shifts (also shown in an image below).   Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 7.0.0 ) or iOS ( 7.0.0 ).   Removed  Report issue The  Report issue  button can no longer be found under your  Account  page.

Here's what's new:   Web: Improvements in the  Schedule Updates to  Security groups Planday app: A new app version ( 7.17.0 ) is available for both Android and iOS with minor bug fixes   Web: Improvements in the Schedule Hide/Show period: From  Tools  >  Hide/Show period , you can now select a  custom period  that should be hidden or visible to employees in the schedule.  It's still possible to hide and show one day at a time by clicking on the  eye icon  for each day in your schedule view.   Employees working in more than one Department: If your employees are working in more than one department, you can now see the name of the department along with the shift times in the  Employees  view.   Approve shifts: When you create a new shift in your schedule, you can now approve the shift for payroll in the same flow. This is done by switching on the  Payroll  toggle before clicking  Create .   Templates: When creating or editing a  Schedule template , we have added the possibility to drag and drop each week to rearrange the order of the weeks.    Breaks: If you copy a week in your schedule or save your schedule as a template, any breaks added manually to shifts will now be copied along with the shift. This also applies to breaks manually added to shift in a template you apply to your schedule.   Updates to Security groups (Access levels) From  People  >  Employees , you can grant  permissions  to your employees, such as managing employee details, the schedule or payroll. This is done by adding them to what you might know as a  Security group . Each group has different permissions that determine the level of access an employee has inside your organization's Planday platform. In order to align across markets and to describe more accurately what a  Security group  is, it has been renamed to  Access level .   This update does not bring any changes to the functionality, it‚Äôs only the text that is updated.   In addition, you can now also add employees to an  Access level  from the full edit view. The  Access levels  can be found in the new  Advanced settings  tab when editing an employee's details, with the same functionality as you are used to from the quick edit.     üí° See regularly updated articles and videos on how to use Planday in our  Help Center  and  video collection .

Under  Reports  >  Revenue , you can select which departments to gather payroll costs and revenue data in one report, to assess the performance of a selected group of departments. As a reminder, the exporting data including payroll costs and revenue data requires Admin permission (more details about permissions in this  article ).     Support for Schedule Filters persisting throughout a login session and in-between sessions If you are using Filters when viewing your Schedule, you might notice that you no longer need to re-apply your filters every time you navigate back to your schedule.   To allow you to work smarter, not harder, we've added support for filters persisting throughout a login session and even in between sessions, if you log out. Filters will remain in place if you: Navigate to different areas of Planday and come back to Schedule Log in or out‚Äã (with the same user) Switching back to a previously used network portal‚Äã Close and reopen your browser or tab Please note, this does not apply if you switch between browsers or users while using Planday.   Absence: Accrued vacation additional updates (DK only) 1. Support for defining an accruing period for employee absence accounts   Depending on your needs for managing absence for your employees, you can now pre-define an accruing period for an employee's account.   This can mean either  setting a start date  &  end date  to the employee account, upon creating it or  using the pre-set default dates  (which will match the commonly used dates for the vacation period/year according to the local regulations). Setting a start date will allow you to automatically account for the hiring date for a new employee, while the end date will provide the option to consider the termination date for an employee or whether an employee needs to switch from one absence account to another.   Please note that when creating multiple employee accounts at once, the end date will be pre-set according to your template settings. You can change the end date after the account has been created, by click on Edit for that account.   2. As a precautionary measure,  unit conversion is no longer possible. This means that if you have created an Accrued vacation account (template) with an accruing rate in Days, you cannot switch to Hours while editing the account. This is meant to prevent accidental changes to your absence accounts or miscalculations.   3. Support for  hours/year  as Accruing rate   For Accrued vacation accounts, it is now possible to set a rate of accrual that accumulates hours per year and a maximum allowance of a set number of hours per year.   With an accrual rate like that, the number of hours corresponding to the rate will be added once per year.   As a reminder, you can set the  Accruing rate  and  Max.

Harvest season begins with some cool new features from Planday:   Added Bulk actions for employee management, including  Bulk edit wage  and  coming soon:   Bulk add to Department Business as unusual might bring with a lot of changes for your staff, and setting up Planday for several employees at once has never been easier. Navigation to and the functionality of bulk actions, for your employees, benefit this month from a series of minor, but important updates:  1. we've added support for  Bulk edit wage , which means that you can select all the employee profiles that need a wage update and get it done in a few steps.   2. and you can now also filter by  Employee type ,  Department , and  Employee group  when you need to (bulk) edit wages for your employees.   If you want to Bulk edit wages, you'll first need to select the employees that need the update, from  People   >   Employee Groups > Edit  (‚úèÔ∏è pencil icon from the right side). Using the filters available, select the employees from the list, by toggling the individual checkbox.  Once you're done selecting, find the  Edit wages  option, at the bottom of the screen (the pencil icon 3 ‚úèÔ∏è).   A new window will open up, where you can set the  Wage ,  Wage type,  and define which date the change will be  Valid from . Save and you're done. You'll be able to see a change history for each of your employees and you can also edit individual wages later, if you need to.  3. you can now filter by  Employee type ,  Department , and  Employee group  when you need to (bulk) add people to an  Employee Group  or soon, to a  Department .  To  Bulk add employees  to an Employee group, go to  People   >   Employee Groups > Edit  (‚úèÔ∏è pencil icon from the right side), then find the  Add employees  button in the top right corner.  Similarly, soon you will be able to  Bulk add employees  to a Department, from  People   >   Departments   > Edit  (‚úèÔ∏è pencil icon from the right side) >  Add employees  button in the top right corner.   4. you can now hide the side menu panel in the  People > Employees  section. For example, this could be very useful if you have a very detailed view of your Employees list.  Simply collapse or expand the menu panel from the icon at the top.   5. in order to simplify things and to follow a consistent pattern, a few buttons were removed. The functionality still exists and can be accessed with no issues, as follows: a. we removed the "" Manage employees "" button from Schedule > Employees view > Manage employees. Instead, you can explore all the options to manage Employee profiles from  People  >  Employees . b. we removed the "" Manage groups "" button and the ‚úèÔ∏è Edit icon from Schedule > Groups view. Instead, you can tweak your Employee groups from  People  >  Employee   groups .   Added more options for removing  deactivated employee  profiles Shifting times also mean a lot of housekeeping work, even in the list of employee profiles on your Planday portal. If you've had to deactivate users recently, you'll be happy to hear that you don't have to wait a long time to have the records permanently deleted from the system (if that is what you need or want).  You can adjust the time-frame from  Settings  >  People  >  General  >  Delete deactivated Employees . Here you can set after how long the inactive users should automatically be deleted. This update expands the range from as low as 1 month to 10+ years.  If you don't find the option you need in the dropdown menu, please contact our support team for assistance.  Improved vacation management with more functionality, including  vacation requests filters  and  editing vacation requests (DK only) The big redesign project that the Accrued Vacation feature brought with it, includes more steps in the release of key features and functionality. For Danish customers, this month brings: 1.  filters  for  vacation requests  overview page   On the  Schedule > Absence requests > overview page  you will find 2 new filters that will help you sort through the vacation requests, by  Status  (All, Requested, Denied, or Approved) within a  Period  defined by Start date and End date.  To see all the vacation requests, simply select All for Status and leave the Period blank. 2. access for  Vacation requests  is now delimited by  Department permissions   To reduce clutter and make your vacation request handling faster, you will only be able to see and handle the vacation requests from your managed employees.  Like this, the  Schedule > Absence   requests > overview page  will show you only vacation requests that are relevant for you.  As a reminder, you can configure the individual employee Permissions from their quick-edit view, under  People  >  Employees  and you can get an overview of how permissions are configured on your portal, from  People  >  Employees  >  Security groups .  3. added support for  editing vacation requests   When a new vacation request comes in, it requires manager confirmation and handling. We've made it possible to edit a request's deduction before approval.  To edit a vacation request, you need to navigate to  Schedule > Absence requests  and find the request in question in the list and click the Edit button, on the right (‚úèÔ∏è).  4. updated  Vacation reports   Under  Schedule  >  Absence accounts , you could always find an overview of your employees' Absence accounts. Now, besides a friendlier look, the account overview page gives you the option to  Export  a Absence accounts report.  You can filter through the existing Employee Absence accounts by  Period ,  Department ,  Employee group,  and  Account status,  just to name a few. Once you've settled on a filter configuration that shows what you need, you can export an Excel file that will contain more details for your filtered Absence Accounts, from the top right corner  Export  button.   The report will contain employee Absence accounts per row, and their details as columns, including:  Absence account type, the account balance, and the activity on the account.  Here's an example of how a report might look like:  Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 6.8.1 ) or iOS ( 6.8.0 ).  First, a quick reminder about the recently added support for üá¨üá∑ the Greek language on the entire Planday platform.  If you need to change your language settings, you can do that from  Account  >  Settings & Privacy  >  Settings  >  Language .  We focus continuously on improving your experience, here's what's new in the recent update for the Planday: Android -  version 6.8.1 Ensured that the app will keep you logged in, even if the internet connection is poor. Fixed an issue that prevented Punch Clock from loading correctly for certain Shifts. Improved stability in the Messaging ‚úâÔ∏è section of the App. Fixed an issue that caused the application to crash when showing a specific view. iOS -  version 6.8.0 Removed a ""No section"" label that would be shown incorrectly, in Schedule in certain cases. Fixed an issue that caused Avatar initials to be displayed incorrectly in the list of colleagues at work. Ensured that a GPS location permission is required for the App, only if Punch Clock is set up to require location data. Fixed an issue that prevented Events and Newsfeed entries to be shown on the right date for the US-based portals. Did this answer your question? üòû üòê üòÉ"

Positivity is key in looking after each other, as we face this global crisis together. Planday is made to run 24/7 and our teams work tirelessly to make this happen. Despite the uncertainty of COVID-19, we will continue to deliver the same level of service to our customers, as we continuously  monitor our performance  and availability across every component. Planday was specifically built to help you and your organization manage operations in rapidly changing environments. Communication is our business and we are well-placed to handle this necessary business change and our service to you. Here's what new features we've been working on, in March:     Web Coming soon: Support for Accrued vacation As a first step in fully supporting accrued vacation in Planday, we've expanded the functionality of vacation management with automatic vacation accrual, tailored for markets where this is a legal requirement. Specifically, this means support for:   the Danish market: including management of the transition period and the difference between the accrual period (12 months) and the vacation spending period (16 months). the UK market: including an accrual rate based on a 52 week average calculation the German market: including an accrual rate based on a 13 week average calculation With this update, managers can set up and start managing accrued vacation accounts and vacation requests. This addition to the web platform brings with it an update for the mobile applications to complement the accrued vacation new functionality. You can read more about the Mobile updates below. If you‚Äôd like to have this feature enabled, please contact our  support team .  Setting up new vacation accounts can be done from  Settings  >  Absence ,  Vacation & Overtime . Also as a reminder, on the web platform, vacation requests from your employees can be found under  Schedule  >  Absence requests , while your employees can request vacation days through the Mobile app, under the  Account  tab; or from  Home  >  Your vacation , on web. Please note: the  Accrued vacation  feature does not support Absence requests from the web platform, at the moment.    Improvements to  Employee form setup : added  Related fields When customizing fields for your Employee forms, you will now be able to create a workflow and connect two fields using the  Related fields  function. Those are text fields that can be attached to Dropdown field options. Related fields will automatically update according to each option selected, when used in a form. A field like this can be particularly useful when information needs to be communicated with flexibility, between managers or from a manager to an employee. For example, if an employee needs to switch work locations on short notice, with a form set up with locations in a Dropdown field, the address could be automatically shown for the new location, through a related field. You can always configure the Employee form, to fit your needs, from  Settings  >  Employee form setup.   Integrations 2 new additions for Planday Open API:  Absence API  and  Contract Rules API In an effort to extend our API coverage, we added support for endpoints related to Planday Vacation and Overtime account types, account balances and to post transactions to employees‚Äô vacation and overtime accounts through  Absence API . Similarly, in support of integrations to Planday by customer, partner and third parties,  Contract Rules API  allows  read  and  update  access to employees' Contract Rules, from Planday. You can find more details on our Open API documentation, at  openapi.planday.com .   Fixes and minor updates A key priority in 2020 is also working on performance improvements and we commit to enhancing existing features alongside developing new ones. So far, you can see the results of this effort in:   Reduced impact from generating a Payroll report on other parts of a portal and added the ability for this to happen in the background. Improved speed and stability for login and portal access, both for the web and mobile platforms. Improved loading times for Schedule feature, both for web and mobile users. Added support for cost center distribution for Visma L√∂n exports . This update enables large businesses, with multiple sites, from the Swedish market, to use Visma L√∂n 300/600 integration more efficiently. Ensured that Scheduled jobs adhere to daylight savings time .     Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android (6.3.0) or iOS (6.2.0). Coming soon: Support for Accrued vacation  Complementary to the web update, the mobile application now offers support for managing accrued vacation. This includes requesting vacation, viewing your vacation balance or handling employee vacation requests, based on accrual calculations.If you need to switch from a set up with a fixed number of vacation days for your employees, to an ongoing accrual of vacation days, please reach out to our support team to try the new feature. As a reminder, you can see all the vacation related details under your Account tab.   Approving Punch Clock entries from the app (Sweden) Adding more features to mobile app is a high priority. Approving Punch Clock entries will allow managers to manage employee working hours on the go. The entries that need your attention will be in Requests > Punch Clock, when this feature is released. The Punch Clock approval feature will be available for both iOS and Android, once development completes. The feature is now available in Sweden. If your business is located somewhere else and you're eager to try this feature, please contact our  support team  to have it enabled.     iOS - version 6.2.0   Cookies are now required for login, for the Planday app. If not enabled on your device, a message will prompt you enable them.

You can choose to calculate the payroll cost as a flat monthly salary, or as an average on each opening day in the given month. As a third option you can exclude your salaried employees' salaries from affecting the costs in the schedule by not assigning a salary to them, but still managing them in Planday. Please note:  If you have worked with salaried employees in Planday prior to February 2019, this feature's release date, there are some important points to consider before starting setup. Check out our  help article  to learn more about how to set up Salaried Employees.     Employee Overview Details From now on, you will have better control of the details displayed in the Employee overview, including their visibility to others. From Hired date to Tax ID and Contact Info, Planday lets you control the visibility of your employees' data more precisely. Go to People > Employee details to edit.   Schedule Search & Filters We have added two new elements to Schedule filters to make your life easier when managing large numbers of employees, groups, and positions. Under the Employees, Employee Groups, and Positions filters you will now find:   A Search field A Select all option To open Filters, select the filter icon to the right of the Department dropdown menu in the Schedule.   Sections added to the Group or Position dropdown menu when creating or assigning a Shift With this update we have infused more details into the Create and Edit Shift windows to increase accuracy when managing large numbers of Employees. From now on, the name of the Section that a Position is associated with will be displayed in the Group or Position dropdown menu when assigning a Shift. This update applies to regular shifts only.   iOS The latest version of our iOS App is 5.14.0. Make sure to download it from the  App Store  or update to access new features below.   Manage Employee Groups and Departments In order to add more flexibility to your daily Employee management, we have now added the ability for Admins to manage Employee groups and Departments directly via the iOS app, just like it works in your browser. Go to People > Groups or Departments > Select a Group or Department, then tap Edit.   Ending support for iOS 9 & 10 To continue providing the best experience for the thousands of people accessing Planday from our mobile apps, after March 1st we will no longer support applications running on iOS 9 or 10.       Android The latest version of our Android App is 5.14.0. Make sure to download it from the  Google Play Store  or update to access new features below.   Manage Employee Groups and Departments In order to add more flexibility to your daily Employee management, we have now added the ability for Admins to manage Employee groups and Departments directly via the Android app, just like it works in your browser. Go to People > Groups or Departments > Select a Group or Department, then tap the pencil icon to edit.   Ending support for Android 4 & 5 To continue providing the best experience for the thousands of people accessing Planday from our mobile apps, after March 1st we will no longer support applications running on Android 4 or 5.   Kiosk (iPad) The latest version of our iPad Kiosk App is 1.0.3. Make sure to download it from the  App Store  or update to access all most recent features.   Integrations & API     OpenSolution POS Integration Update We have updated the current integration of the Scandinavian POS system OpenSolution to support another method of revenue import and bring you more flexibility. While the previous method was based on a sum of the totals in the Z reports, the new update enables selection of an alternative method of revenue import, where the total is the sum of all article categories with an option to include or exclude any discounts.   APICustom Employee Fields We have made custom fields available in the Open API to give you even more flexibility when building on Planday. The following fields are available:   We've extended the Employee endpoint to enable you to create, read, update, or delete custom fields on an employee's profile. We've added a new Field definitions endpoint that can be used to fetch the available custom fields and values for a specific Planday portal, identifying the custom fields and values for creating or updating employees with custom fields via the open API. Schedule API update The Shift endpoint has been improved, now the GET shift endpoint includes the Punch Clock shift ID if there are Punch Clock entries on the shift. The Punch Clock shift ID can then be used for another query to fetch the exact Punch Clock times. This means that you can now get the available Punch Clock data regardless of the Punch Clock entries' status - approved or not.   Punch clock API update In order to identify the Punch Clock entries regardless of the approval status, the endpoint will be updated with a Punch Clock shift status. Additionally, the approved shift filter that made the Punch Clock entries unavailable after Punch Clock approval is removed, which means that the Punch Clock entries' data will be available regardless of approval status.

The improvements made to the new Payroll export page are: More flexible date range selection Advanced employee selection using filters Optional file format for PDF and HTML Improved report summary     In addition, we have moved the other subtabs from Payroll to their own separate page that can be accessed from the Payroll tab in the top menu.

Updates to the Absence module: Shift type selector  on individual absence account types It‚Äôs now possible to select  Shift types  for your individual absence account types. This means that if you have different Account types and you want to use different Shift types for accrual and/or monetary payout, you can now select this in the different account types setup.

This will be available with the next version (7.7.0) for both Android and iOS.     Please note: The screenshot is from the iOS app as an example, you may notice minor differences between the iOS and Android apps, but the functionality is the same.     Integrations:   Improvements to the  Xero integration  (for the UK only) We have given the Xero integration a new design to improve the flow for setting up and managing the integration in Planday.   The functionality remains the same and you still have access to the same setup as before, but you will find that the integration has gotten a new design.   Once you have activated the integration, you will have access to the page in the screenshot above. This new page gives you a better overview of your integration setup and you can easily manage your organisations, employee data, earning rates, and leave types.   You can read more about how to connect to a Xero organisation and configure the integration in our  Help Center .

Example: You can choose to remove this security action for Schedule admins meaning they can no longer ignore Working time rules in the schedule, but keep it for Admins so they can still choose to ignore the Working time rules.

Here's what's new:   For web Improved support for  Absence accounts  (DK & UK only) Add a  message  when requesting time off Multiselect and Search  in the filters for Absence overview Visible spending period  for Absence account when requesting time off Split request  between different accounts Updated content in  Absence notifications Coming soon:   Account section   Web Improved support for  Absence accounts  (DK & UK only) Add a  message  when requesting time off When employees request time off on the web under  Home  >  Your vacation  >  Requests  >  Request vacation , they are now able to add a message to their request.  This is already possible on the App. The message will be  visible  in the request, in the overview page for requests, in the history of the request, and in the notification sent to the manager.   Multiselect and Search  in the filters for Absence overview   Under  Schedule  >  Absence accounts , and  Schedule  >  Absence requests  you can now both search and select multiple options in each filter.    Visible spending period  for Absence account when requesting time off   When requesting time off, you can now see the start and end year for each Absence accounts available for spending in the chosen absence period, next to the name of the account.   In the example below there are different types of Accounts with different spending periods: Only one year visible :  Annual leave (2021) The spending period for this account is only within the same year. No year visible :  Overtime When it's is no end date for an account, no period will be shown -  often used for Time off in lieu accounts. Both start and end year :  Vacation in hours (2020 - 2021) The start and end years for the spending period are different on this account. Additional account with both start and end year :  Vacation in hours (2021 - 2022) The account  Vacation in hours  is available with different periods because the spending period overlaps. Ex. in DK the spending period is longer than the accruing period. For this reason, the employees will be able to spend vacation from 2 different accruing periods when the spending period overlaps.   Split requests  between different accounts It's now possible to deduct a part of the absence from one account, and the rest from another account, in the same absence request.  The  cost  of an absence request can be  split between different accounts  if the employee has more than one active Absence account in Planday: If an employee requests absence that costs more than their balance on the chosen account, the system will divide the request between the chosen account, and a second account. The manager can amend this after the request is sent. If an employee requests absence from an account with enough balance for the entire vacation, the request will be made for the chosen account. The manager will then have the option to divide the days/hour between different accounts, both before and after approving the request. To move the cost of a day from one account to another, you will need to first remove the cost from the current account, and then add the cost to the other account. Click on  Show detailed impact  to see and amend the specific cost of each day. Please note: The cost of each day cannot exceed 1,00 days or 24 hours altogether, and you can only split a day between either daily accounts or hourly accounts, not both. From  Schedule  >  Absence requests  you can see the names of the accounts used in a request. When the cost is split between different accounts, both account names will be visible. To see how many days/hours that's deducted from each account, you can click on the request to open it and click Show detailed impact.   Updated content in  Absence notifications   In order to align across markets and adapt to the different use of our Absence accounts, we have changed the text in the Absence notifications from  Vacation request  to  Time off request . Example of how the notification for managers looks like now: This change does not bring any changes to functionality and the management of Absence accounts and Absence requests. Along with the possibility to  split requests  between different accounts, the employees will now see their  remaining balance  of all accounts used in the request.  Example of how the notification for the employee looks now when the request is approved, and the cost is split between different accounts: Coming soon:   Account section Soon, you'll be able to find the  Account section  under the  Profile menu point  in the top right corner.   From the Account section, you will get an overview of your invoices and subscription plan details, as well as the option to download invoices from directly inside Planday.   The Account section will only be accessible to a new Account Admin security group.

This month's release notes include:   For web: Improvements to Employee management Support for  Quick Edit > Departments , per Employee Restore Departments  and  Restore Employee groups Support for backdated  Vacation requests (DK only) Support for  Employee data  visibility restrictions, by Department Support to Edit Department access within  Security groups Punch Clock : Health check (details below) For the Planday & Kiosk app: Support for  Finnish Support for the  Punch Clock  Health check Updates to  Messages  (including the removal of Forced Read) Support for  Available balance  in Time off. Information about upcoming changes for  supported devices  - iOS. (details after the Web section)   Web Improved  Employee management  list with more search and sorting functionality 1. In your Employee's list, from  People  >  Employees , you can  search through the list by Mobile number.   This expands the list of search options for your employee list to:  - First or Last name,  - Email address,  - Salary identifier,  - Tax ID,  -  and now:  Mobile number.   2. On the Employee groups page, from  People  >  Employee groups , you can now view and sort the list by Salary code. A Salary code column was added to the Employee groups page, to improve the visibility of Employee group details. Similar to the other columns of the list, the Salary code column is sortable in ascending or descending order. This also applies if your setup uses Salary code 2. Added support for  Quick Edit > Departments , per Employee, for users with HR Manager permissions This means that HR managers can add or remove the employees they manage from the Departments on your portal, in the  Quick edit  view. This can be useful in situations that require quick changes to your organization's structure or increased flexibility in how your staff is managed.   For a user with an  HR manager   permission  level, this addition grants edit rights only for Department membership and only for the employees directly managed by the user in question. This addition does not allow access to view or edit any other Employee data field.   To edit Departments, through this permission level, you'll need to navigate to  People  >  Employees  > click on the Employee entry and edit Departments from the Quick edit menu on the right-hand side of the screen.   If you'd like to use this permission level addition, please reach out to our support team (from the messaging icon, in the bottom right corner), for assistance.   Added the  Restore Departments  and  Restore Employee groups Admins and HR managers, that have access to edit Departments or Employee groups, can now also Restore deleted Departments (or Employee groups, respectively).   To restore a deleted Department, you'll need to navigate to  People  >  Departments  and find the  Restore Department  button, in the top right corner. This will prompt a new window where you can select which Department you'd like to reinstate and whether or not employee memberships should be kept as they were prior to the deletion of that department.  If left in its default state, restoring a department will reinstate the memberships.   Similarly, to restore an Employee group, you'll need to find the Restore Employee Group button, under  People  >  Employee groups . A similar prompt will appear, giving you the option to choose which group to restore and whether or not to bring back the employee memberships to that group.   If you'd like to use this new feature, but it's not already available on your portal, please reach out to our support team for assistance.   Added support for backdated  Vacation requests (DK only) As part of the recent Vacation module updates, it is now possible to register backdated Vacation requests. This could be useful if a Vacation request needs to be registered in the past or in an inactive Vacation account. To backdate a Vacation request, simply select the (past) vacation account it should belong to, from  Absence requests  >  Request vacation  >  selected Employee  >  Account type .     Coming soon Employee data visibility restricted by Department membership Currently, when an employee sets their contact information to be public (visible for their colleagues) it becomes visible to all other employees in the organization. This might not be in line with their data privacy expectations and might make it difficult to browse the Employee list, for large numbers of employees. The upcoming update will limit the visibility of their contact info to the members of the same Department(s). This means that only their colleagues will be able to see their contact info if it's set to public. More details about employee data visibility, in this  article . Support to Edit Department access when adding employees to a Security group Soon, when editing an Employee's security access (from People > Employees > Quick edit), you will need to define which Departments the access level applies to.   Adding This will give you the option to configure which Department the access rights apply to and how, for that employee. This also allows you to set whether the access rights should be applicable to all employees or only employees with that department set as primary if you use that feature. Punch Clock: Health check before starting a Shift (punch in) In an effort to make it easier for you to stay on top of your tasks and have all the information you need to keep your staff safe, in the current fluctuating times, we're working on a feature that allows you to set up a quick Health check through  Punch Clock . This feature will give your employees a quick way to inform you if they're no longer fit for work and will help you keep your staff safe, which is particularly relevant in the current COVID-19 landscape.   The COVID-19 Health check will appear as a pop-up when an employee taps ""Start Shift"" in their Punch Clock app, asking whether they present any symptoms or have been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19. If either situation is applicable, you'll be notified right away through a Planday message and your employee will be advised to self-isolate, contact you and their health care provider for the next steps.   To use this Health check, you'll need to already be using Punch Clock on your portal and enable it from Settings > Punch Clock > Survey. Once enabled, the quick survey will appear across all the Punch Clock platforms you might use (web, mobile app, or the Kiosk app)   Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 6.11.0 ) or iOS ( 6.11.0 ).

The  Forced read  functionality has been removed from all Planday platforms, stems from feedback, and the number of reported issues (blocking employees from using the app as intended).  This change kickstarts the re-design of the  Message ‚úâÔ∏è  section of the app, as the Forced Read and Forced Answer options will be reframed as a  Required   reply,  in an upcoming app update.  Feel free to share any feedback you might about removing this functionality, through our support team or in an app review.  Available balance  instead of Current balance, in your  Time off  overview page.  This means that the balance shown at the top of the screen now accurately represents the number of days available for you to request. Like that, the available balance takes into account your current balance ( to date ) and the impact on your balance of any pending or approved vacation coming up.  When you make a new vacation request, the Available balance will update immediately, while your request is pending approval.  If the request is denied, the Available balance will return to what it was prior to the request.   Android -  version 6.11.0 Ensured that  Punch Clock  behaves as expected, without errors when approving punch clock entries for Shifts containing Breaks. Fixed an issue that prevented the  Employees  list from being shown correctly when in a custom order Ensured that data privacy settings are respected across all areas of the Planday app, including the  Colleagues at work  list. Fixed an issue that caused an error when trying to edit & approve  Punch Clock  entries missing a Shift end time.  iOS -  version 6.11.0 Improved responsiveness for the Punch clock widget Began preparations to discontinue support for iOS 12 (or lower).  It is expected that, as of 2021, Planday will no longer be supported on devices using iOS 12 or lower.

For this new feature, you will need to have  contract rules  setup for your employees. Here's a quick  guide  to get you started. With everything in place, you will have an overview of what's on your employees' schedules, how many hours they are from fulfilling their contract requirements or how many hours they worked above that.

Here's what's new: Web: Prevent employees from modifying their names via their employee profile The  First name  and  Last name  fields can now be set as read-only on the employee profile. Previously it was not possible to apply changes to the setup of these two fields. This enhancement will help prevent employees from editing their own name, adding non-standard elements such as emojis, or a name that doesn't match the one entered on an integrated payroll system.   As an admin, you can now go to  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form set-up  > edit the  First Name  and  Surname  field, uncheck the  Required field  and  Allow editing  option under  Personal settings.   See  How to modify the employee form   Improved Absence account management: Individual Salary codes are now visible and editable in the account pop-up Managing Salary codes for individual Leave accounts (or Absence accounts) has become more convenient with the latest update. In the past, the Salary code of each Leave account was not visible. This may have caused confusion when changes were applied to the Salary code assigned to a Leave account template, as the code is not automatically updated for existing employees' accounts that were created applying said template.   However, you can now easily view and edit the Salary code for individual Leave accounts, ensuring consistency across templates. This improvement streamlines the task of ensuring uniformity in Salary codes, providing a smoother experience in managing leave.

You don't have to do anything to enable the change, as it will automatically apply to your Planday account. As part of our empowerment initiative, we constantly strive to create a better experience for you and your employees when working with Planday. Editing employment details is a crucial system function when adding new hires or updating existing employee information. To facilitate this experience, we have introduced a few user interface changes and improvements to the functionality of editing employee details.  Where can I find it? You can access these changes from the same place you are used to by going to  People  >  Employees  > clicking on any existing employee >  Edit. You don't have to do anything to enable the change, as it will automatically be applied to your Planday account. What has changed? Employee details user interface Editing employee details opens up in the new Planday user interface with a modern layout that you can view in single or dual-column.  ‚ú®NEW OLD New menu: User Actions Commonly used actions such as  deactivating an account ,  editing a username  and  resetting an employee's password  are grouped under the  User Actions  menu . In contrast,  these items were under the User Information section before.

NEW OLD ‚ú® Personal details tab Employee details   Groups & Wages became Employment The  Employment  tab replaces  Groups & Wages  section, which now maintains everything to do with the employee's job in one place. You can set the  Employee type , add the employee to a  Department,  select the  Employee group  the user should be part of, add their  contracted availability  and set their  salary . NEW OLD ‚ú®Employment tab Groups & Wages   Creating contracts is now part of the new Documents tab. We have moved the Employee's past and current  Contracts  under the restructured  Documents  tab.

Harvest season begins with some cool new features from Planday:   For web: Additional language support:  Japanese Locale Improved  data entry view  in the  Data Center  (for Pro & Enterprise) Improved support for  Absence accounts  (UK & DK only) Start balance  on Accrued account type Additional information in the  Absence account report Permission to  approve own absence   request   or not . Updated  user interface Coming soon :  Account section For the Planday app: Additional language support:  Japanese Locale API/Integrations: Zapier  integration Coming soon:   Visma.net Payroll  integration (NO only)     Web: Additional language support:  Japanese  Locale The  Japanese language  is now supported in your Planday portal. To change the language for your Profile on the web, hover over   the Profile menu point   in the top right corner >  Edit  >  Language  > choose your preferred language.     Improved  data entry view  in the  Data Center  (for Pro & Enterprise) The  Data entry table  under  Reports > Data Center > Data sets > Edit data  has been improved in order to more closely resemble the schedule itself. For managers navigating between the Data entry table and the Schedule, this will make it easier to see which  Positions/Sections  they are entering data for.‚Äã ‚Äã The dropdown list of  Positions  now also shows the name of the  Section , so it's easier for a manager to distinguish them, especially in the case where positions have the same name in different sections.   The  Data Center  feature is available for the  Pro  and  Enterprise  plans. Remember that you can always reach out to our  Support team  (chat icon, in the bottom right corner) if you have any questions or need assistance.     Improved support for  Absence accounts  (UK & DK only) Start balance  on Accrued account type When creating or editing an Accrued account type under  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types  you now have the option to set a  Start balance  for the account type. This value will be the start balance on all accounts both now and in the future.  The start balance can later be overwritten in your employee's individual accounts for each period. Additional information in the  Absence account report The Absence account report that you can export from  Schedule  >  Absence accounts  >  Export  is improved with some additional information: Department : one or multiple departments that your employee is associated with. Note:  a note from your employee's Absence accounts. Period start date and Period end date : dates are related to the chosen period. Leave pay : the value of leave pay at the end of the chosen period. Permission to  approve own absence   request   or not. We have added new permission that allows you to choose if your managers should be able to  approve their own absence requests or not .  The permission to approve own absence requests is connected to your  Security groups . It's by default turned on for all Security groups that currently have the permission to approve absence requests in general, so there are no changes made to the current permissions. With this new permission in place, you can now choose to   remove the right to  approve own absence requests  from specific  Security groups .  Example: You can choose to allow HR managers to approve their own absence requests, while Schedule admins cannot approve their own absence requests. When removing the permission to approve own absence requests from a Security group ( that already has the permission to approve absence requests ), the buttons to Approve or Deny are removed from their own request as shown in the picture below. Please reach out to our  Support team  (chat icon, in the bottom right corner) if you need to make changes to your Security group's Permissions. Updated  user interface We have updated the user interface for both  Absence accounts  and  Absence requests , to optimize the visual experience and structure the different sections on each page. Coming soon : Account Section We are soon ready to release the  Account section  where you will get an overview of your invoices and subscription plan details, as well as the option to download invoices from directly inside Planday.  It will be available under the Profile menu point in the top right corner, for all Account Admins.   Along with this, there is a new Security group called  Account Admin  in your portal. The Account Admin security group is, as of now, the default group for those responsible for signing up and setting up Planday for your organization. The Account section is only accessible to those in this new  Account Admin Security group .   This additional Security group will not affect your existing configuration, for Security groups and access permissions. Instead, the  Account Admin  group is meant for information purposes and does not grant access to any of the Planday features, on its own.   If you need to make changes to the permissions and security groups or you encounter something unexpected, please reach out to our  Support team  (chat icon, in the bottom right corner).     Mobile: Additional language support:  Japanese  Locale From  Account  >  Settings & Privacy  >  Settings  >  Language , you can now select  Japanese  as your preferred language in the Planday app. Available with the newest version of Android (7.2.0) and iOS (7.2.1).     API/Integrations:   Zapier integration The  Zapier integration  will allow you to use Zapier's available apps to integrate with Planday and be able to send  Revenue data ,  Create employees , or import  Business Analytics data  into Planday. This can help improve your scheduling solutions and be able to better infer how to improve your metrics. It can also help avoid duplicate data in both your HR system and Planday, as this would allow for employee data to only have to be created in the HR system and the integration can automatically create the same employee in Planday.   Head over to our  setup guide  for the Zapier integration to get started.     Coming soon:  Visma.net Payroll  integration (NO only) Soon you will be able to export payroll files for  Visma.net Payroll  from Planday. The new payroll export file matches the specification for importing variable payroll data to Visma.net Payroll.   This new integration will be available on the integrations page under  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview . Once activated and configured, the payroll export becomes available under  Payroll  >  Payroll export .‚Äã You can download the report and import it to Visma.net Payroll for an easy pay run.

From the  Schedule  >  View settings  >  Data Center formulas  you can select formulas from the Data Center to be displayed in your schedule.

Improved support for  Absence accounts  (UK, DE & DK only) New option for  Leave pay  calculations: Hourly wage. We have added a new option for calculating Leave pay for accrued absence accounts in hours:  Hourly wage . The  Hourly wage  option can be found under  Vacation earnings  when creating or editing an accrued absence account in hours and it will base the Leave pay on the individual employees' wage.   Improved support for  Overlapping shifts  in  Absence requests. We have made some improvements to the selection of  Shift types  for overlapping shifts in  Absence requests .  As a manager approving an Absence request from  Schedule  >  Absence requests  >  Edit request , you have the option to select what should happen to the employees' overlapping shifts. If the option to  keep the shifts and change the Shift type  is selected, you are required to also select a Shift type for the overlapping shifts.  There's no Shift type selected by default, to ensure that you as a manager can make the correct decision on which shift type to use for each employees' request.  If you select the option to  keep the shifts and change the Shift type , there's a validation in place to ensure that you also remember to select the Shift type for the overlapping shifts before you are able to approve the request.

Instead, it will bring a full list of categorized options for you to choose what you want to have shown in your Schedule.   This could include information about Shifts, scheduling details from your employees, financial information, and your Planning metrics. Please note that what information you may have access to depends on your  permission level  and/or the  subscription plan  active for your organization.   Added additional settings and customization options for  Auto-schedule If you are on a Pro plan (or above), you're probably already using the  Auto-schedule  feature to get a draft of your complex Schedule within minutes. You'll be happy to hear that a few more options are now available for you, including: adjusting the result quality vs.  processing time ; how to account for your employees'  Availability  preferences; choosing between a rotating or fixed scheduling approach and whether to take into account breaks or working hour requirements You can find more details about Auto-schedule in our  setup guide  and more details about the advanced settings in this  article .

Vacations accounts  and  Overtime accounts  are listed separately under  Absence accounts   From  Schedule  >  Absence Accounts , you can now get an overview of all the Overtime accounts set up for your organization, from the standalone  Overtime accounts  tab.   This means that Overtime accounts will no longer be shown in the same list as Vacation accounts.

This applies to all the related aspects to Overtime, meaning that: Overtime accounts  will become  Time off in lieu accounts Overtime requests  will become  Time off in lieu requests , and so on.

Improved absence request  notifications You can now decide whether or not you want to send a notification to your employees after handling their absence requests.   Whether you approve or deny a request, you can toggle on or off the option to  Send a notification to that employee . By default, this option is enabled.   This can be particularly useful if you don't want to distract someone at work or send too many notifications to an employee's inbox. As a reminder, you can find and handle Absence requests from  Schedule  >  Absence requests .   Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 6.15.0 ) or iOS ( 6.15.2 ).

Please contact Planday support team if you want to enable the Activation codes feature bypassing the IP addresses for your Web Punch Clock.   If you‚Äôd like to use the Punch Clock with a fixed IP address, see how to  add/update your IP address here.    What is a Punch Clock Activation code? A Punch Clock Activation code is a unique identifier that‚Äôs created once a device is activated with it. It is stored on the device itself.   Punch Clock Activation Codes enable you to set up access to  PunchClock.Planday.com  on specific devices on locations with  dynamic IP addresses  (fixed IP is not required).   This will enable you to set up a tablet of any kind or web browser with the  Web Punch Clock  interface, allowing your employees to punch in.    Please contact Planday support team if you want to enable the Activation codes feature bypassing the IP addresses for your Web Punch Clock. Once enabled, you will see the ability to generate activation codes for Punch Clock profiles. See below how to generate them. How can I set up a Punch Clock Activation code? ‚ö†Ô∏è  Before setting up your Activation codes, you must create one or more  Punch Clock profiles  on your Planday account.

Some of my Departments use a fixed IP address while others use a dynamic IP address. What do I do? When Punch Clock Activation Codes are used for multiple locations/Departments, the same validation method must be used for all locations, so  either  IP validation  or  Punch Clock Activation Codes validation. You would then need to use: either IP validation and  set different fixed IPs  for your Departments or Punch Clock Activation Codes validation and set all your Departments with one profile for each. What happens when a Punch Clock profile is deactivated? You need to reset the activation code by following the steps described in  How can I set up a Punch Clock Activation Code . I‚Äôm asked for an Activation Code when I log into  punchclock.planday.com . Why and where do I find this code?

The Schedule is at the heart of Planday. You will likely use it daily to manage your operations. This article will help you to get an overview of the Schedule page in your web browser. You can navigate to the Schedule from the menu bar at the top of the screen. üí° You can use most of the functions described in this article in the desktop browser and the  Planday app . More details about scheduling can be found in the article  Getting started ‚Äì Set up your business  and the collection of articles on schedule. Select the appropriate view of your schedule In the upper left area of your schedule, you can decide which Department's schedule you wish to see, change your view setting, and select which period should be displayed.   Choose a Department In Planday,  each  Department  has its own schedule . You can select which schedule you want to display from the drop-down list if you have set up several departments.   Select Employees, Groups or Positions view There are three views in the Schedule;  Employees ,  Groups  and  Positions . You will find one view most valuable depending on how you set up Planday. Try all three options to see which view works best for you.    Set a period or date to view  Select from the drop-down list which period you would like to display. The options available are  Day, Week, 2 Weeks, and Month . In addition, you can click on  Today  to jump directly to the current date and use the arrows to the left and right to move backwards and forwards in the calendar.   View settings, Schedule templates, and Tools  In the upper right area, you can take further actions regarding the Schedule, such as enabling optional features, creating and editing templates, accessing several functionalities and applying filters.   View settings This menu gives you a list of options to enable on your schedule. These include settings for Shifts, Schedule, Finance and  Auto schedule  (Pro/Enterprise only).   Templates Under the  Templates  dropdown menu, you can create a Schedule template, edit existing ones, save your current schedule as a template and roll out a template in the Schedule.

Tools You can approve multiple shifts from the  Tools  dropdown menu, delete the current shifts on the schedule, print the schedule, export the Schedule as a CSV file,  hide or show periods on the schedule , view your  schedule history , and much more.  What are the different shift statuses üí° For a detailed overview of working with shifts, see the articles  create, edit,   move, copy or delete shifts . A normal shift is displayed with the employee's name and time; by clicking on the shift, you can view more information or  edit the shift . Shifts can also have different colours to provide a quick status. The screenshot below shows six common examples of shifts you may encounter in Planday. üî¥ (1. Monday) - Open shift:  If you have a Shift that you need to be covered, but don‚Äôt know who can cover it, then create it as an  Open shift  for employees to request. Open shifts are easy to recognize by their red colour in the Schedule. üî¥ (2. Tuesday) Open shift (requested):  When one or more employees apply to take an Open shift, you can immediately see it in the Schedule with the text  Shift request . Assign the Shift and inform the employee to make sure you have all shifts covered. üü¢ (3. Wednesday) Approved shifts:  When a Shift is marked as ready for payroll, it turns green in the schedule. This makes it easy to see which shifts have been approved and which are still awaiting a manager's approval.  üñç (4. Thursday) Shifts with a Shift type:  Use  Shift types  to record illness, training or another special event that distinguishes a Shift from a normal Shift. Shift types are created with a colour code and can be viewed directly in the Schedule. Administrators can always create and edit existing Shift types. ‚è± (5. Friday) Shifts with Punch in time:  If you are using the  Punch Clock , you can see the exact times employees have clocked in and out of their shifts on the Schedule. In this example, an employee clocked in at 7:08 and clocked out at 15:05.  üü° (6. Saturday) Shift for sale:  If an employee can't work their assigned shift, they can offer it to their colleagues with the right skill set to cover it. A shift offered for sale will appear on the manager‚Äôs schedule as yellow, providing an opportunity to help out. See here  Open shifts, Shift requests and Shift swaps for Schedule managers  and see here how employees can  swap, hand over and sell shifts via the Planday app . See a daily overview and shift count Press the Shift count at the top of the schedule to see an overview of shifts and availability for the day. You can choose to only see specific types of shifts by pressing the settings ‚öôÔ∏è icon. This also allows you to send messages to specific sets of people; for example, you might want to message only employees working on a day.   How to see payroll costs and revenue on the schedule At the foot of the schedule, you can input your  revenue  for the day and compare it to your outgoing  payroll  costs. If you have set a goal percentage for payroll costs against revenue, you can see a visual indicator here to keep you up to date.   Enable this by going to  View Settings  and turning on  Revenue  or  Payroll hours & costs  under the Finance settings.   Visualise Contract rules and employee management Using the Employees view on the schedule, you can see the following functions and shortcuts: See when you have deviated from an employee's contract  If you have set up  Contract rules  for your employees, you can see a visual indicator around their profile picture to see if they match their contracted hours. In the example below, Maria has a green ring around her profile, indicating she matches the exact amount of hours in her contract. A user with insufficient hours has a yellow ring, and a red ring shows around a user scheduled for too many hours.   Edit an employee's profile or get a shift overview:  Hover your mouse over an employee's name to reveal options. You can  quickly edit  (‚úé) their information right from the Schedule. You can also press the overview button (shown in step 2) to see a  Shift overview  of an employee or send a direct  message .    Manage employees: Reorder the list of your employees on the Schedule in the order you want to see. Create custom sections to organise employees. This view will be visible when you sort your schedule by  Custom.   Prioritize the order of your employees:  Press  Sort by  to reorder your employees in the schedule. You can also toggle between ascending and descending order by clicking the sort icon on the right of each option. Need more help?

Apply templates and finish your schedule in minutes! Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For Admins and Schedule managers. Get to know the  basics of Scheduling here . What are Schedule templates? Schedule templates  are great for creating your schedule's foundation or saving recurring days and weeks for later use. Templates can be applied to multiple periods simultaneously, saving precious time and making schedule creation a breeze.    Using Schedule templates, you can create a consistent schedule for multiple or single employees, apply  Shift types  to specific days or ranges, and exclude  Positions  when they shouldn't be filled. You also have the option to create  Open shifts  in the template and let your employees apply for them just like you would on your normal schedule. Schedule templates overview You can find the  Templates  menu in the top right corner of the  Schedule  page. From here, you can do the following: Create  a new Schedule template. Save  your current schedule as a template. Edit  existing Schedule templates. Apply  an existing Template to the Schedule. Copy week  lets you duplicate the current week‚Äôs schedule to a future week. How to create a Schedule template When creating a new Schedule template, you have two options. You can: Create a new template  giving you an empty schedule to work with. Week template  - This lets you create a week‚Äôs worth of schedule that you can replicate for more weeks. Day template  - This lets you create a day‚Äôs schedule that you can apply for specific days, for example, a day template for busy occasions such as New Years' eve or a ready-to-go busy day's schedule that might occasionally occur. Save an existing schedule  as a template for editing and re-use. Create your template as you would create a schedule. You can duplicate the template week into more weeks and plan for fortnightly or months‚Äô worth of schedules. Press  Save  when done.   Move and copy Shifts in the template editor If you have the same Shift on multiple days, you can copy it by holding down the  Alt/Option‚å• (Mac)  or  Alt (Windows) key and place it wherever you need. üí° Copying shifts works across all three views in the templates editor: Employees, Groups, and Positions. To move a Shift, simply drag and drop it to where you want it. Duplicate and reorder weeks in the template editor You can duplicate a completed week in the template editor by pressing the Plus (‚ûï) icon or delete it by pressing (‚úñÔ∏è). It is also possible to reorder the weeks by moving them in the editor window. Apply a template to your schedule When applying a Schedule template, it's essential to check the settings and the date you apply the template from and decide what to do about existing shifts on the schedule, if any.  First, navigate to the day or week in the Schedule where you want to apply the Template. Then press  Templates  >  Apply template  from the menu. Select from the existing templates that you have created.   Settings to consider when applying a Schedule template  When applying a Schedule template, you have three options to choose from: Update existing, and add new shifts  - This option will try to merge the existing Schedule with the information from the Template: if a user already has a shift in the schedule on the same day as a shift in the template, it will be replaced by the template shift.  Delete all and add new shifts  - This option will delete everything currently in the Schedule, and then add the information from the template. Keep existing shifts and add new shifts  - This option simply adds the template shifts onto the schedule without making any changes to the existing shifts. This means nothing is lost, but the new shifts may conflict with pre-existing shifts. When switching between the options, you should see a preview of how the end result will look. We recommend applying templates to empty days or weeks. This gives you the best overview and control. Apply number of times  - Choose the number of times that the template should be applied. For example, if you are using a day-based template, you can apply it up to 14 times to populate a fortnight in the schedule.  ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are using a larger template that covers several weeks, we recommend that you limit the number of times you apply a template. For example, if your template has 2 weeks of schedule and you apply it 4 times, you will generate schedule for the next 8 weeks.  Use the  Employee  drop-down menu to limit the employee(s) that the template should apply to. By default, all employees are selected. By selecting individual  Shift types  you can tailor which shift types will be applied to the schedule. For example, on Monday you might have a shift type for a weekly meeting, which you can then deselect when applying the day to the rest of the week. As with employees and shift types, you can choose to include or exclude certain  positions  when applying your template. This may be useful if some of your positions are only expected to be filled during busy periods. When you've checked the settings, select  Next . Planday will check for any  working time  violations before you confirm by clicking  Apply .  Note that any manual breaks included on the Shifts will now be preserved and copied over when you copy a week or create and use a Schedule template. üí° If you have made a mistake and want to start over, press  Tools  >  Delete this week  to remove any created schedules. You also have the option to  hide certain days or periods  from the schedule. Duplicate schedule to a future week If you have a weekly schedule you want to reuse, you can quickly copy it by going to the  Templates  menu and selecting  Copy week . Choose the week you want to copy your schedule to and confirm.   When you copy a week, all existing shifts that aren't already approved for payroll, or don't have Punch Clock entries, will be overwritten. üí° The best way to use  Copy week  is to always copy to an empty week. This way, you don't risk overwriting anything by accident. Schedule templates and Working time rules When you apply a Schedule template to a week, a check against  Working time rules  is run. This is useful for ensuring you don't schedule employees in breach of working time regulations in your company or industry.  Checks against Working time rules are also made for every change you make to the schedule, such as moving or copying shifts, adding employees to open shifts, or modifying the shift length.

In Planday, you can record the presence and punctuality of employees with the  Punch Clock  functionality and prepare your payroll by approving shifts. Employees can use the Planday app to clock in and out. However, if required, you can release the function exclusively for use in a web browser via  PunchClock.Planday.com Set up Punch Clock for use on a web browser Register your IP addresses This solution allows employees to punch in and out using a web browser by visiting  PunchClock.Planday.com  from their work premises. Access to this functionality requires an administrator of your Planday account to register the IP address from which to use the Punch Clock at work.   Follow these steps to enable this functionality: Log in to your Planday account from a computer on a network your employees will be clocking in and out. Navigate to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  section >  Employee Access , then  Web access  section > Add. Your  Current IP  address will be displayed here. Add this address if you are on the network where your employees will be clocking in and out. Enter the desired IP address under  Add IP . You can also provide a name and description. Example: Hafenstrasse location / This is the address of our caf√© on Hafenstrasse. Confirm by clicking on  Save . After the IP address is registered, your employees can punch in and out via  PunchClock.Planday.com  using their email address and password, provided they are connected to the internet via the registered IP address (WLAN network).   If you operate in  multiple locations , you can also add the IP addresses of these locations. This ensures that employees can also clock in and out there.   What to do if your IP address is not recognized If you cannot access  PunchClock.Planday.com , your dynamic IP address has probably changed or you. Many internet service providers change their dynamic IP addresses from time to time. You may need to update your IP address in Punch Clock.   See the guidance above or follow this article on  registering your IP address  to edit your existing list or register more addresses. Alternate: Use Punch Clock activation codes if you use dynamic IP addresses See the article on  Setting activation code for Punch Clock . Alternate: Make punching in faster using PIN codes instead of passwords See the article on  Using PIN codes for web Punch Clock .   Set up Punch Clock for use via the Planday app Configure mobile app access Here's how to proceed if you want to give your employees access to the Punch Clock via the Planday app: Navigate to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  section >  Employee Access  >  Mobile   App Access  section. Select  Yes  for  Punch Clock used in mobile app  and check ‚òëÔ∏è  Punch Clock allowed in certain physical locations.  Set up geofencing for access through the mobile app Geofencing is used so employees can only punch in and out if they are physically present in an area. Employees must stay in a predefined workplace; otherwise, they will not be allowed to punch in or out of their shifts. To set up, click  Add new location . Navigate to the map view. Enter your address in the search bar or drag and drop the location pin to the suitable place of your location. Set up your geofencing radius by dragging the arrow icon. Planday recommends a radius of at least 100 meters, as a smaller radius may be affected by the smartphone's GPS accuracy or GPS interference in the area. Add the Departments whose employees can punch in and out of this location. Give the location a name. Confirm by clicking on  Save . üí°  After setting up your location, employees can only clock in and out if they are within the specified radius and have GPS turned on their smartphone. For the Punch Clock to work through the app, Planday requires GPS or Location access - This is used solely to punch in and out, not to track locations or otherwise. Give employees unrestricted access to clocking in and out If clocking in from a physical geo-location is not essential for your business, you can set the Punch Clock to let your employees clock in without being at a location or connected to your WIFI.    To enable this option, check ‚òëÔ∏è  Punch Clock allowed everywhere.   Allow employees to punch in for an unscheduled shift You can allow your employees to punch in without a shift assigned to them. If an employee punches in without a shift, their hours will be visible on the schedule for the department they clock in, and you can administer or approve the shift like any other shift.    Go to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Display settings  and select  Yes  to  Punch in without a shift.   Limit the use of the Punch Clock to the Wi-Fi network at work It is also possible to allow the Punch Clock to be used via the app when employees use the WIFI at their workplace without relying on geolocation. An IP address must be specified for this. To enable this option, check ‚òëÔ∏è  Punch Clock allowed from the workplace Wi-Fi . üí° If your employees are using iOS devices running iOS14 or later, the Planday app will require location services to be enabled to punch in and out.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins. Get to know the  structure of Planday here . What is a Shift type? Shift types  mark non-regular Shifts on the schedule. For example, a Shift type can be set up for marking trial Shifts or illnesses on the Schedule.    This opens up a wide range of options for you when using the Planday schedule to document variations in Shifts and use them for reporting or payroll. In this article, you'll learn how to create Shift types and what you can use them for. How to create a Shift type To do this, navigate to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types . Click on  Create  to generate new Shift types.   If there are some pre-generated Shift types or you have already created some, you can see and edit them here.    When the  Create Shift type  window opens, you can set the following details to define your Shift type.   In the example, a fictitious Shift type 'Sickness covered' is created.   Name  - The name is visible to all users with access to the Schedule. Salary code  - Learn more about Salary codes in the article  How to set up Salary codes . You can use Salary codes to make your payroll clearer, or if necessary, use them with external payroll integrations. Leave this field blank if it is not relevant to you. üí° Please note that depending on the setup of your payroll system, you might want to set up  Payroll supplements  in order to match your  Salary codes  correctly. Colour  - A colour code can make it easier to recognise the Shift type on the Schedule and when pulling/exporting  Shift type statistics reports . Rate adjustment -  Define how the Shift type should affect pay. To pay the full wage when the shift type is applied, leave the value at 100 per cent.  If no payment is to be paid, e.g. for unpaid absence, enter 0 Percent.  For hours that should be paid at a higher rate than normal, enter a value greater than 100 per cent, for example, 150 per cent for 1.5 times pay for weekend shifts. Optionally, instead of percentages, after selecting from the drop-down list, you can also enter an  amount that replaces existing rate  or an  amount that is added to existing rate  in the local currency of your Planday organisation. Description  - Leave a description for internal understanding, especially if several  Schedule managers  work with Shift types. The description is only visible when editing the Shift type.   Additional settings  Allow conflicting shifts  - If you leave this unchecked, you'll receive a warning in the Schedule if you try to schedule the same employee for two shifts simultaneously. If you have circumstances that require registering an employee for multiple shifts simultaneously, enable this option. Allow booking  - Checking this box will allow the Shift type to be booked when set to  Open, sold, or available to swap . This should typically remain disabled for Shift types used to register sick leave, training, or staff meetings. Overwrite when applying a template  - A Shift type with this option enabled will be overwritten when you apply a  Schedule template . Uncheck the option for Shift types used to plan future events like staff meetings. Include in Schedule print  - If you print or download your schedule, check this box to include the Shift type. Include in Schedule message  - When sending messages to employees on the Schedule for a specific day, the Shift type will be included. This option should typically be disabled for Shift types used to register sick leave. Count hours in payroll report  - Disable this option for Shift types that don't need to be included in the total of worked hours in the payroll report. For most Shift types this option is enabled.   Payroll supplements  - Check this box if you want hours from this Shift type to be affected by  Payroll supplements . Break  - Check this box if you want breaks to apply for this Shift type. Read more about  setting up and working with breaks . Meal contribution  - Check this box if you want meal contribution and deduction to apply for this Shift type. Meal contributions and deductions can be set up by going to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Meal contribution and deduction . Affects fixed salaried : Enable this option if this Shift type should apply to fixed salaried employees. Confirm by clicking  Save . You can change the settings later by editing the Shift type. üí°  Please note: When creating a new Shift type, check whether it should be linked to an existing  Contract rule . This will ensure the completeness of the contract term as all relevant Shift types will be included. Learn more in the article on  creating and applying Contract rules . How to change a Shift type of a shift on the schedule You can manually change the Shift type of a shift on the schedule. You have several options to do this: Click on the three dots on the shift and select  Apply shift type . Then choose from the list. (see screenshot) Click on a shift and edit it, select a new Shift type from the drop-down list under  Shift type  and confirm via  Save . When editing several shifts simultaneously, you can apply a Shift type to all selected shifts.  Statistics on Shift type usage If you use Shift types, you can view insightful reports: View sickness absence, trial hours, punctuality, overtime or other Shift types you have set up. To do this, navigate to  Reports  >  Shift type  s tatistics . Find out all the details in the article  Using Shift types for reporting and payroll . Use Shift types to record overtime (TOIL) hours One of the methods for recording  overtime  is based on using Shift types that you can set up for overtime or undertime hours. In practice, minus or overtime hours are transferred to your employees' overtime accounts as soon as the corresponding Shift type is applied to one of their shifts.   To learn more about this method and compare it with other ways of overtime management, take a look at the article  How is TOIL handled with Shift types .   Set pay rates using Shift types Shift types can be applied to any employee on a per-shift basis to make payroll adjustments such as unpaid leave or manual overtime pay.    Example of shift type to set an extra allowance  In the example shown above, a  Shift type  is created for employees who work overtime and should be paid 50% on top of their normal wage (1). Additional settings (2): The option to  Allow conflicting shifts  has been enabled in this example, as the Shift type may only apply to part of a shift for an employee. The  Allow booking  option is disabled since a shift with this Shift type applied to it should not be swapped or set to open. The option  Overwrite when applying a template  is deselected to prevent a template from overwriting the Shift type. The option to  Include in schedule print  and  Include in schedule message  has been deselected, while the option to  Count hours in payroll   report  is enabled so that the shifts count towards worked hours for payroll in this example. Lastly, the Shift type has been set so that shifts marked with it will count towards  Payroll  s upplements ,  breaks , or  Meal contributions , and its use will impact salaried employees. If you want to deduct pay from a salaried employee‚Äôs fixed salary, you would need to set the Rate adjustment to 0%. üí° Remember to set the hourly wage to 0 for your salaried employees so that the system applies the extra payment to the salary.

Set weekly or monthly budgets With the basics of revenue in place, you can go to  Settings  >  Reports  >  Revenue  to set weekly or monthly budgets for sales and labour costs. This can give a more accurate picture of your results week after week.   üí°  You can also add additional payroll costs, choose to ignore Open shifts, and account for VAT/Sales tax in the  Advanced  tab. You can enter revenue and labour rate forecasts for each department depending on your operational goals. It's necessary to enter these forecasts to compare your actual values with those in the overview.   Go to  Settings  >  Reports  >  Revenue  >  Weekly budget  to do this.

Enable payroll costs in the schedule You can view the payroll hours and costs of your salaried and waged employees in the schedule to help you to plan your shifts effectively.    üí°  You can activate the settings for payroll costs to appear on the schedule by going to  Schedule  >  View settings  > and activating  Payroll hours & costs. If you pay employees a fixed salary instead of wages, you have various options for calculating the salary costs in the schedule. In this article, you will learn about those calculation methods and can decide which method to use.   To assign a fixed salary to an employee, see the article  How to set an employee's fixed salary . Select an employee >  Edit  >  Employment  >  Salary  >  Edit salary . In the top section of the edit window - Payroll information - you should see the data entered for your employee's salary:   If salary data has been added, go to the next section  Payroll costs in Schedule. üí° Remember that the cost allocation and payroll are different. Salary will be reflected in the payroll as a set amount regardless of how you allocate the cost in the schedule. Calculate payroll costs based on Salary amount In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Salary amount .   You can see a direct calculation of this in the lower section, Estimated costs per hour. Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary amount is divided by the number of shift hours in the schedule for the current salary period. When entered in the rota, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works that day. Example: An employee is paid a fixed salary of ¬£2000. The estimated cost per hour - ¬£26.67 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of shift hours in the schedule - in this case, 75. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift in the schedule is given as ¬£160.02 (6*¬£26.67). üí°  The  Payroll start day  is the day of the month from which each salary calculation will begin. This value can't be set as a higher number because the month of February has 28 days (with the exception of leap years). Calculate payroll costs based on Scheduled hours In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Scheduled hours .   You can see a direct calculation in the lower section  Estimated hourly cost . Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary is divided by the expected working hours in the Schedule. When entered in the schedule, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works on that day. The total cost may therefore differ from the fixed salary, depending on how many hours are assigned to the employee. The actual salary cost will not change for Payroll even if the cost on the Schedule is higher/lower.   Example: An employee receives a fixed salary sum of ¬£2.000 and is supposed to work 60 hours per month according to their contract. The estimated cost per hour - ¬£33.33 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the expected hours worked. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift is indicated in the schedule as 200.00¬£ (6 * ¬£33.33). Calculate payroll costs based on Business days In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Bussiness days . For  Business days , select the days of the week to be included in the calculation.  For  Show in Schedule for , select the department in which to display the salary costs. In the lower area,  Estimated daily cost , you can see a direct calculation. Optional: You can change the day of the month from which the salary is calculated at  Show cost calculation each month, starting from . Confirm your selection by pressing  Save . The estimated daily cost is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of opening days in the  Pay period  (by default: Monthly). The estimated daily cost may vary from month to month, depending on the business days in the period.   Don‚Äôt show (default) By default, the option  Don't show  is set.

Act on employee comments from the Punch Clock. Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ This article is for beginner admins.  Here's a quick guide on  setting up Punch Clock  if you haven‚Äôt configured it already. The  Punch Clock  feature helps you stay in control of work attendance. You can use it to compare scheduled shifts to worked shifts and map out what to improve in your schedule.     With Punch Clock enabled, you can approve timesheets for payroll directly in Planday. Punch Clock is available on the web platform, the stand-alone  Kiosk app , and the  Planday app . How to approve Punch Clock entries in Planday You can approve Punch Clock entries using the  Pending actions  widget on the front page or by going to  Schedule  >  Punch Clock .   The Punch Clock page allows you to review and approve entries (shifts) per week or day, see approved shifts, and get a daily or weekly overview of approved vs unapproved stats. On the  Approve per week  (or  per day ) page, you will find all the clocked entries or shifts needing approval by a  Schedule manager or Admin .   Shift time  - This is the originally scheduled shift time. Punch time  - This is the actual punch-in and punch-out time. Start  &  End : These are times to be approved for payroll. This will differ from the punch-in/out times if you use  rounding rules . If there is no punch-out time, in case an employee forgets to punch out, this will be indicated by a red flag. You can manually enter a time in the End box and approve the Punch Clock entry. Adding an  End  time for a Punch Clock entry will also end the shift the employee forgot to punch out of. This is particularly useful if the Punch Clock is set up to use geofencing and the employee is no longer at the right location (which prevents them from using Punch Clock).   ‚ö†Ô∏è If there is no punch in or out time, there will be no punch clock entry. In this case it is not possible to manually create an entry, but instead, you should adjust and  approve the shift from the  Schedule .    Lastly, If these fields cannot be edited, it is because  deviation rules  are in place and you must decide if you want to use them to account for overtime or undertime.   Length  - This indicates the total length of the shift.   A single shift cannot be longer than 24 hours; if this happens, you must split the   shift before approving. Break  - This box is selected by default if you use automatic  breaks .   You should untick this box if an employee did not take a break. Comment  - You can see any remarks about the shift from the employee, upon punching in or out. Encourage your employees to leave a comment if they deviate from the scheduled shift. Selection box  - With the selection boxes you can pick which entries should be approved. Press the box on the top to bulk-select all entries for approval.  Alternatively, you can select individual entries for approval by checking the box in front of individual punch times. Once you have made the necessary corrections, press  Approve selected  to finalise the selected entries. Similarly, when an entry needs to be removed, select it from the list and press  Delete selected . Once these shifts are approved, they are ready for payroll. Approved shifts and Punch Clock entries can be found under the  Approved  tab,  Overview per day  or  Overview per week . üí° Please note that if you use an ePOS integration, such as  Tevalis , the Punch Clock data will only appear in Planday once the user has clocked both in and out for their shift. How to approve Punch Clock entries using the Planday app As a  Schedule Manager or Admin , you can adminster the clocked shifts from the  Planday app . Besides being able to punch in or out yourself from a scheduled shift, you can supervise and approve your employees' Punch Clock entries. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Please note that approving of Punch Clock entries on the Planday app is available for all Planday organisations except those using  Deviation rules . As you open the Planday app, whenever a new entry needs your attention, it will immediately appear in your  Requests  widget, under  Punch Clock entries  and also under  More  >  Requests > Punch Clock entries .   Tap on the  Punch Clock entries  to view the entries pending your approval. You will have a quick rundown of each entry and the option to  Approve  on the spot. You'll get a confirmation and the entry will disappear from the list.   The list will contain Punch Clock entries for  completed  and  ongoing Shifts , so you can add an end time and approve an employee's shift if they didn't punch out themselves. üí°  Unlike on the web, the mobile app does not support adding payroll supplements manually or splitting shifts longer than 24 hours for Punch Clock entries. For either of those, please use the web component of Punch Clock. Also, please note that the list of pending entries will only show entries from the last seven days. Log in to Planday on the web to see all the previous entries.   Need more help?   Please search for answers in the üîç  Help Center  or watch our ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  video tutorials .

Follow the steps described above to create your first break rule of the day For the following break(s), add only the additional break time and not the total break time. The breaks will accumulate. For example, if you want to give your employees one 10-minute paid break if the shift is 4 hours and another 10-minute paid break if the shift is 7 hours, configure this as two separate break rules:   Break rule 1 :     Break rule 2 :   This will result in 2 x 10 min paid breaks, a total of 20 minutes if the shift is 7 hours or longer.

But before you start using  payroll reports  from Planday, we suggest going through the following checklist.  1. Are the Salary identifiers correct? Make sure the salary identifier for all employees is correct. You can check or edit the salary identifier of a user by going to  People  >  Employees  >  Edit user . The  salary identifier  is placed in the  Personal details  tab under the  Payroll  section.   Salary identifiers, also called payroll IDs, are used to identify each employee in a payroll system.   The identifier has to be the same in both Planday and the payroll system to ensure each employee gets their correct pay. 2. Any employee changes since the last time you did payroll? If you add or edit employee data in Planday, you can pull a  report  to check for changes that should be updated in the payroll system as well.   You can pull a change report from the portal by going to  People > Employees > Tools > Export data.  Select  Employee changes  under report type and press  Create report . 3. Register salary codes used in your payroll system Salary codes  are used in a payroll system to identify transactions such as normal hours, overtime, or hours with an additional allowance added to them. If you do an export to your payroll system based on a file from Planday, each of the transactions in the file is usually associated with a salary code. The salary code for normal worked hours can be changed at  Settings > Payroll > General > Salary codes The salary code for supplements can be changed at  Settings > Payroll > Payroll supplement  > Edit the specific supplement Salary codes can also be added to shift types from  Settings > Schedule > Shift types 4. Is everything approved in the schedule? Before you create a payroll report in Planday, we recommend that you check that each shift is correct. You can mark it as ' approved ' and generate a report including only approved shifts. When browsing through your schedule, look out for any shifts that have any colour other than green.   Green indicates that the shift is approved.   Go to  Schedule  >  Tools  >  Shifts overview  for a faster way to check, how many approved or unapproved shifts there are.   When you've gone through the checklist you can pull  payroll reports  from  Payroll > Payroll export . Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins. Learn about  Creating and editing shifts here  or familiarise yourself with  Scheduling on Planday . Are you an employee?  See  How to swap, hand over and sell shifts via the Planday app  or learn  How to apply for open shifts from the app . What is an Open shift? On Planday, it is possible to create shifts without assigning them to specific employees. These types of shifts are called  Open shifts .  Open shifts can be helpful if you want to plan a Shift where employees can request work based on their role, skill set and preference. How to create Open shifts? To create an Open shift, proceed like you would when creating a Normal shift, but do not assign it to an employee.   In the  Employee view , create an  Open shift  in the top row of the Schedule. If you create the Shift in an employee's row, you can select Open shift as the first option from the employee drop-down list. The Open shift will be the default selection when creating a Shift in the  Groups or Positions view . Once an Open shift has been created, it appears highlighted in red üî¥ on the Schedule. Only employees assigned to the corresponding Employee group can request the Open shifts created for those roles. The Shift remains open and un-assigned until an  admin or a Schedule manager  approves the request.   Swaps, Hand over and Sell shifts Employees can  Swap, Hand over or Sell  their shifts amongst colleagues within the same Employee group and Department. Shifts remain assigned to an employee until a colleague and manager confirm the action. Swap  - allows an employee to exchange their Shift with another colleague and take one of theirs with mutual agreement. Hand over (transfer)  - enables an employee to give away a shift directly to a colleague with mutual agreement. Sell  - allows employees to request their colleagues to take over their shift. Shifts marked for sale appear as Open shifts to colleagues. üí° Before the request reaches you, the action must be confirmed by the colleague (for swap or handover), or the on-sale shift must be requested (for handover).   Optional notification settings By default, Planday will notify you of each request so no action can be taken without your consent.

If you are outside your workplace or at the wrong location, go back and try again. Ensure that you're connected to the correct company Wi-Fi Your employer can optionally restrict the use of the Punch Clock to an approved Wi-Fi network of their choice. In this case, you can clock in  only if your device is on an approved Wi-Fi network , and not from another network or mobile data.

This feature differs from  availability  settings, where employees indicate their wishes or availability for work without having a contractual obligation or an agreement. Are you an employee?  See how to indicate  your availability wishes .   What is Contracted availability? The  Contracted availability  feature allows you, as an admin or schedule manager, to mark specific days or time intervals in which you have agreed with your employee to work. Typically, this is based on an employment contract or terms you have in place with agreed hours and days. For example, you can hire staff for weekends or morning shifts only and mark their contracted availability so you can be alerted if you schedule them outside these periods.    This feature can help you get an overview of specific scheduling guidelines or contractual agreements that may influence the schedule and make it easier for you to see who is available and when. How to set an employee‚Äôs Contracted availability You can add or edit an employee's  Contracted availability  from the quick edit menu by going to  People  >  Employees . Click on the employee's name, open the quick edit window and then press  Add  under Contracted availability.   This will open up the Contracted availability window. You can select the days and mark specific time intervals during those days when an employee should be available for scheduling.   In the above example, an employee should work on the following days: Mondays and Tuesdays, from 9 am to 5 pm, Wednesdays and Thursdays from 10 am to 6 pm, and then Fridays from 8:30 am to 4:30 pm. You also need to specify when these settings should come into effect by setting a  Valid from  date. That way, you can keep track of an employee's availability even if their work pattern changes over time or if you need to add a new availability but have it apply from a particular time in the future.   Using Contracted availability on the Schedule You can then navigate to the Schedule and create a new Shift. When assigning a Shift to an employee, a green symbol will indicate the presence of Contracted availability for this employee. You can hover over this symbol to see when the employee is contracted to work.

Contact our support team if you'd like to try it out. Sometimes, filling a schedule can be a complex jigsaw puzzle of preferences, needs and headaches. Auto-scheduling can support you by providing a schedule suggestion for the time frame and department you need in a matter of minutes. The feature will automatically assign open shifts based on Contracted hours, Availability, Absence and Working time rules. What is Auto-schedule? Auto-schedule is a scheduling feature that allows you to quickly assign open shifts to multiple employees at the click of a button. This means that once you have determined how many people should work each day and created the open shifts you need, Planday can help assign the shifts for you. If you like the schedule suggestion, you can approve it and then move on to your daily tasks with time to spare. How to use Auto-schedule tool Before you use the tool, you'll need to ensure you have a few things in place. You have Open shifts in the schedule waiting to be assigned to your staff. Every employee on the schedule has their necessary Contract rules entered in Planday. Read more on how  Contract rules  work. Your employees set their Availability preference for the upcoming period. You dealt with the Vacation requests for the timeframe and reminded your employees to record their desired time off beforehand. You added Working time rules to ensure your schedule respects contract terms, labour laws and union rules. Read more on how to set up  Working time rules . These steps will need to be completed only once, and then they'll work for you whenever you need to fill out a new schedule period. Once you are ready, you're very close to getting a schedule draft made for you! All you need to do now is to go to the correct department's schedule and click  Tools  >  Auto-schedule.   Specify the number of weeks for which you want to receive shift assignment suggestions. Optionally, specify employees, positions or  Shift types  that you want to skip for the time being.  Once you are ready, click on  Start Analyzing  and the system will start calculating the schedule suggestions for you.   If some preparation steps are not completed, you may get warning messages. You can  Ignore  these messages if they are irrelevant to you.   You will see the schedule in the preview view when the calculations are done. Click  Apply schedule  to accept the proposal. You cannot undo this step; however, you can delete the entire schedule week by week and start over again. üí°  If the proposed schedule does not meet your expectations, Cancel and start a new analysis. If there can be several solutions for a schedule, the Auto-schedule with the same prerequisites can give you different suggestions. Sometimes, some shifts are left open by the Auto-scheduling tool. This happens when either Availability, Working time rules, or Contract rules prevent a shift from being assigned. As a scheduling manager, it is your decision whether a Working time rule can be ignored or whether there is a need to schedule someone over their contract requirements.   Auto-Schedule - Good to know The Auto-schedule considers the following components when creating its proposals: Matching  Employee groups  and  Skills  of the open shifts and employees. The  hire  and  deactivation  date of employees. Conflicting shifts  - If employees have already been assigned a shift in another department or position at the same time, they will be excluded as candidates for an Open Shift. If an employee has already  requested  to take an Open Shift, that shift will be assigned to the employee with priority. Availability  - employees that marked themselves as available will be prioritised whenever possible. At the same time, those marked ""Unavailable"" will not be assigned shifts whenever possible.  ‚ö†Ô∏è  Please note:  If you have selected the Intervals option in the Availability settings under Available options, the Auto-schedule will not be able to consider availability. It is recommended to select one of the other options. Absence  - Employees with approved absence requests cannot be assigned to Open shifts during this period. Working time rules  and  Contract rules  - If there are entries about the arrangements between you and your employees, they will be taken into account by the Auto-schedule.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents What are Contract rules? Use  Contract rules  to compare your employees‚Äô scheduled hours to those they‚Äôre contracted for. Setting these rules allows for better insight into which employees have enough hours, which can be contracted for additional hours, and which ones have exceeded their contract limit. How to create Contract rules First, go to  Settings   >  People   >  Contract rules   >  Create Contract rule   Name the Contract rule, enter a description, and select New interval. If you have set up a Contract rule with multiple intervals, you can set one as primary so it is visible inside the schedule (week, month or year).     Next, enter the values for the Contract rule and Save. The start date set is the day and date from which the scheduled hours are counted. For example, if the start date is set to 1 June with an interval length of 1 week and 40 total hours, we can then expect that 40 hours should be worked from the 1st to the 7th, the 8th to the 14th, and so on. üí°  It is recommended to set the start date to a Monday for a weekly interval or to the 1st day of a month for a monthly interval. If certain  Shift types  should be excluded from the Contract rule, you can deselect them by going to Applies to > Shift types. The example below excludes training hours from the employees‚Äô weekly minimum hours.     How to assign a Contract rule to an Employee  To assign a Contract rule to an employee, go to the  People  page, hover on the employee‚Äôs name and select the pencil icon ‚úé to  edit .    From the  Personal details  tab, scroll down to the  Payroll  section where you can find the  Contract rule.   Select the required Contract rule from the drop-down menu and press  Save . Using Contract rules while scheduling When you navigate the schedule, you‚Äôll see a colour status on employees with a Contract rule set. The three different statuses described below indicate if the employee is on track to meet their contracted rules: üü¢ Green - The employee is scheduled for the correct amount of hours. üü° Yellow - The employee is not scheduled for enough hours. üî¥ Red - The employee is scheduled for too many hours. To show if an employee‚Äôs scheduled hours meet the requirements of their Contract rules, hover on the status icon next to their name. From there, you can see the deviation hours, which indicate the difference between the hours specified in the Contract rule compared to the scheduled hours for the employee.   Select the icon to see a more detailed overview of the Contract rule and to switch to different intervals if more than one has been set. üí°  Please note: The scheduled hours for an employee are calculated based on all assigned shifts within the interval date range across all departments. Breaks are subtracted, and if any shift types are excluded from the Contract rule, then shifts with this  Shift type  are also subtracted from the calculation.   Need more help?

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For advanced admins. If you‚Äôd like to see examples of Payroll supplements and how to use them, go to  Payroll Supplements ‚Äì Use Cases . You can create payroll supplements to automatically adjust employees‚Äô hourly rates or salaries based on set criteria. For example, you may want to pay your employees overtime if they work more than 10 hours during the day by using a  normal supplement . You may want to pay your employees double on certain holidays using a  day-based supplement . Or based on their  Contract type  some employees should be allocated a percentage of their hourly rate if they work on the weekends. How to create a Payroll supplement First, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement.   Here, you‚Äôll have the option to create different kinds of supplements.  If you click on the  Create  button under  Payroll supplement,  several options will be available from the drop-down menu:   1. Choose the type of supplement Supplement type : Normal Supplements, Week Based Supplement, Day Based Supplement and Contract rules supplement. Title : Name of the supplement. Description : Include a description (optional).   2. Define when the supplement should apply Based on the chosen Payroll supplement, different options will determine when should the supplement apply after how many hours at what time of the day and if it should be a monetary increase or a percentage increase. See  Payroll Supplements ‚Äì Use Cases  to learn more.    3. Define what days it should be applied and when it should be valid Days of the week : Select which days of the week the supplement should be applicable. Days from Bank Holiday calendar : Choose specific days from the  Bank Holiday calendar  in the system. Valid from/to : Set when the supplement comes into effect or ends.   4. Set filters defining who the supplement should apply to Employee groups : Select which  Employee groups  are eligible for the supplement. Employee types : Select which  Employee types  are eligible for the supplement. Shift types : This option allows you to define to which Shift types the Payroll supplement should apply. Contact our support team if you want to enable this option on your Planday.   5. Enable additional settings Affects salaried employees : If selected, the supplement will also affect those with a fixed salary rather than an hourly rate. This may not work with percentage-based supplements. Affected by breaks : If there is a break in the shift, should the break affect the shift time and therefore the total amount of time being affected by the supplement. Select this option if the supplement shouldn‚Äôt be paid during break periods. Enforced payment : Enable this to ensure that the supplement is always added to the pay ‚Äì even though other supplements are present in the same period of the shift. If you don't select this option and two supplements are applied to an employee at the same time, only the one with the highest value will be given. Allow over midnight : Select if a shift goes over midnight, potentially into a day not selected as being covered by a supplement, should the supplement continue to apply on the hours that fall in the next day after midnight. Overview of different Payroll supplements in Planday Normal supplement Normal supplements are used when an employee‚Äôs pay rate should be adjusted at a certain time of the day, or after a specified amount of hours into a shift. You can set the increase or decrease in pay rate based on a percentage of a wage, or as a set monetary value. For example, full-time employees should be paid an additional 50% of their normal wage after 8.5 hours of work. Week-based supplement Week-based supplements are used to apply a supplement after a set number of hours worked in a week. For example, you can create a week-based supplement that will apply an additional 50% of an employee‚Äôs normal wage after 40 hours have been worked in a single week. Day-based supplement Day-based supplements are used when employees work more than one shift per day. The day-based supplement will account for all hours worked during the day. For example, if an employee works more than 9 hours in a single day, they get time and a half for each hour worked over 9 hours. Manual supplement These supplements are used when you manually want to add supplements to your employees, such as bonuses. It applies directly to the shift in the schedule. You can set a fixed amount per shift or per hour.   Contract rules supplement A Contract rules supplement can be applied to all employees that have a specific contract rule to pay them automatically any overtime supplements. For this type of supplement to work, you should already have  contract rules set up  for different employee types under  Settings  >  Contract rules  >  Create Contract rule.  This governs how many hours an employee should be working and lets you see and compare if they go beyond the contracted hours in the schedule and pay them a supplement.   Personal supplement You can set a fixed amount that your employees can get on a monthly basis.  For example, an employee receives a bonus for being a team leader in a busy period.

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For advanced admins and developers: If you want to integrate your system with Planday using our Open API, visit  OpenAPI.Planday.com . You can discover the API's core functionalities, best practices, and authorisation flow there. Planday's Open API allows you to connect with other online services, creating a more robust integrated solution to serve your customers better.   Please note that all steps in this guide require an Admin  access level  on Planday and an eligible subscription package (Pro or Enterprise).   Connect an Open API app with a known Application ID If another system's integration setup step instructed you to connect their application to Planday and provided you with an application ID, you can enter it by navigating to  Settings  >  API access  >  Connect App  button.   Once you insert the application ID provided by the other system and click  Save ,   the app will appear in your application list. To obtain the application's token, click  Authorise , review the permissions you're providing to the application, and confirm by clicking  Authorise  again.  üí°  You can copy the app's token from the tile on the Settings page anytime.   Create Open API credentials The easiest way to access Planday's Open API is by creating a new API application. Go to  Settings  > under the Integrations section, click  API Access  > click  Create App . Add your application's name to the title field and then use the scopes below to determine the data accessible through API using the application's credentials. Once you've made your choice, click  Save .   Your new application will show in the application list. The last step is to grant the application access to your data using the  Authorise  button, then confirm your selected scopes. The application is now authorised, and you can use the credentials on the tile. If you wish to set up the application on several Planday organisations, follow the chapter  Connect an Open API app with a known Application ID  using the APP ID of the application you just created. Reauthorise an app after deactivating an account When you deactivate an admin‚Äôs account who previously authorised any of your Open API applications, the systems using these credentials will lose access to your Planday data. This is a security measure to keep your data safe. To reauthorise the Open API applications, open the  Settings  page, select  API access  in the left menu and locate affected applications. Next,  Authorise  the application again and confirm its permission scopes. ‚ö†Ô∏è  A new token is going to be generated for the application. You must update the new token value in all systems using the Open API application to access your Planday data. Need more help?

Single Sign-On is a system that allows users to use a single set of login credentials in more than one place. This frees up time and reduces hassle in the long run, as your employees will be able to log in faster and know more about how their information is used.  Complete the SSO configuration in Planday by following the steps below, and start getting the most out of using Planday together with your identity provider.   Please, also note that the minimum level of security encryption supported is SAML Assertion Signing Algorithm:  SHA-256 Supported identity providers Your identity provider should support Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML 2.0) and you will need to be able to generate a SAML metadata file from your identity provider's configuration page. The username (email) field in Planday is used to identify the employee in your company's identity provider. Planday supports, but is not limited to the following identity providers: Google:  https://support.google.com/a/answer/6087519 Auth0:  https://auth0.com/docs/protocols/saml-protocol/configure-auth0-as-saml-identity-provider#manually-configure-sso-integrations Microsoft:  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-single-sign-on-non-gallery-applications Please, note that you will most likely need to have administrator access to your provider to be able to access the needed details and set up the SSO in Planday. We would therefore recommend involving your IT department (if applicable) to assist with this setup.   Getting started Start by navigating to your identity provider‚Äôs website and configure SSO and generate a SAML 2.0 metadata file. You can find links to help articles for SSO configuration for each of the Planday supported identity providers in Planday's SSO configuration page or you can find links to setup guides above. Configure your identity provider SAML 2.0 metadata file to Planday SSO. Before you generate your SAML 2.0 metadata file, please be sure that it‚Äôs aligned with Planday's SAML 2.0 SSO entity.  Download the Planday XML file with the details about Planday's SAML 2.0 SSO entity to see what is needed for proper SAML 2.0 authentication with your identity provider. You can download the Planday.XML file from this link:  https://id.planday.com/Saml2 .  Please, note that as per the XML file: Entity id : Planday Reply URL :  https://id.planday.com/Saml2/Acs Please be aware that your identity provider also needs to be set up to support the expected Claim Types for SAML response in Planday SSO listed below: Email AddressURI:  http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress Name IdentifierURI:  http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier User Principal NameURI:  http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn Configure SSO in Planday 1) Authentication provider settings Navigate to Settings > Security > Single Sign-On (SSO), select one of the supported identify providers, and click  Configure . Continue the configuration by adding a title to identify this configured authentication provider. The title is only visible in this configuration menu for admins who want to manage it.  Next, add a label to the button that will be displayed on the login screen of your Planday portal (e.g. Sign in with Microsoft). On the right side, you‚Äôll see a button preview. By enabling ""Set as default for login"", new employees will automatically be assigned to use the authentication provider for login when they are created in Planday. NOTE: This will not apply for Employees created through the bulk upload (excel template). You will have to set this for each employee in People > Employees > Edit employee. 2) Upload SAML metadata file To configure Planday to connect with your identity provider you'll need to upload a SAML Identity Provider Metadata file or import the file by using a link.  You can use the link on the right side to ""Learn more about how to generate the metadata file. 3) Assign existing employees Finally, select and assign the employees that should log in to Planday with the authentication provider.  Click Save in the top right corner. 4) Create new employees and set authentication provider If the checkbox  Set as default for login  is not marked, you can specify how employees should log in from the Create employee form. Navigate to People > Employees > Create employee, fill out the fields, and specify the authentication provider. You can choose ""None"" if the employee should use their username and password to log into Planday. Remember to send an invite email, so the employee can set their password. 5) Change employee login You can also change the authentication provider for an employee from the People > Employee section. Click on the user and update the SSO Authentication provider field. If the employee should log in with a Planday username and password, simply select ""None"". Remember to send an invite email, so the employee can set their password if needed. 6) Log in to Planday with SSO When the SSO configuration is completed, you will see a new button to log in through the identity provider on the login screen. Employees assigned to use the identity provider authentication method will have to click on the new button (e.g. Sign in with Microsoft). In this case, whether they used the right login button or attempted to log in with their Planday username and password, the employee will be redirected to your identity provider for authentication. When the employee is logged in, they will be brought back to Planday.  Please be aware, that access to Planday is based on the session configuration within your identity provider. Log in on web Login on mobile 7) Deactivate employees When employees should no longer have access to Planday, you have to ensure they are being deactivated in Planday, as well as in your company‚Äôs identity provider. Deactivating employees only in the identity provider will potentially allow access to Planday for up to a few hours, due to the session management of webpages. Once set up, the single sign-on authentication method will allow your employees to log in faster and reduce the hassle of having to remember yet another username and password. This addition to the Planday login will give you the flexibility to cater to each employee's wishes and, in the long run, will give one less admin issue to worry about.

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins.  Go here, if you look for a guide how to set up this integration . General How do I deactivate the integration or disconnect a company? To deactivate the entire integration: In the Integration overview, find Personio and select  Options  >  Revoke authorisation . To disconnect a single company: In the Integration menu, find Personio and click  Manage . Find the company you would like to disconnect, select  Manage company  >  Disconnect company  and confirm your choice on the pop-up. How do I reconnect/update the API credentials? If you are shown an error message stating the connection was lost, select  Reconnect  and re-enter your Personio API credentials. If your Personio API credentials have changed, update them in the Integration overview >  Personio  >  Manage company  >  Change credentials .   Employee import Why can‚Äôt all my Departments be imported? Depending on your Planday plan, there may be a maximum number of Departments you can set up. On the Starter plan, you are limited to having 1 Department, while the Plus and Pro plans allow up to 5 or more Departments. Imports will possibly be incomplete, if this number is exceeded.  Read here, how to handle the Departments limit . Why can‚Äôt my employees be imported? If you have an error message saying that your employees couldn‚Äôt be imported from Personio into Planday, it could be because of the following reason: You have some required fields for employee creation in the employee form setup in Planday. If the required fields that are set in Planday are missing in Personio for the employees you‚Äôre trying to import, then the import won‚Äôt happen To fix this, you can either: In Personio: fill out the required fields in the employees‚Äô profiles Or in Planday: go to  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup  > find the required fields and edit them Under  Create employee , untick the box  Required field ‚¨áÔ∏è   Then in Planday, go back to Personio‚Äôs integrations settings and try and import your employees again. What happens if a mapped employee is deleted in Personio? If the option  Import all current and future employees  is enabled in the integration setup, the employee will be deactivated in Planday during automatic sync at 11 PM of the following day. If there are future shifts, they are changed into Open shifts starting deactivation date. Future absences created by the integration will be removed. If the option is not selected, no changes will be made automatically. What happens, when I delete the Employee group ‚ÄúPersonio‚Äú? It is not recommended to delete this Employee group. You can keep it, and additionally assign your employees to other Employee groups as well.  If you delete this Employee group, you risk losing information on hourly wages or salary.   If the option  Import all current and future employees  is enabled in the integration setup, the Employee group would be added again during the sync at night, and employees would be re-added to it. How do I see which employees are mapped between Personio and Planday? You can check this in Planday by going to the Employee group  Personio  under  People > Employee groups . This group is automatically assigned to all mapped employees. What happens if an employee already exists? If an employee profile with a matching e-mail address is detected during import, that account will be overwritten by the new employee data from Personio. Why can‚Äôt I select an employee for import? Employees can only be selected for import if their Personio profile contains a First name, Last name and email address. What happens when I update employee information in Planday? Personio to Planday is a one way synchronisation, which means that employee information is pulled from Personio at the time of sync and updated in Planday. If you use this integration, we recommend using Personio as the main source of employee information and update any changes there instead of in Planday.   Absence data import Can I add imported absence to the employees‚Äô Absence accounts? If the system you are using for absence management is Personio, the purpose of having that information in Planday is barely to keep an overview when you plan your schedule. Therefore, it is shown as shifts. As of now, no automated function connected to Planday Absence accounts is planned. üí°  The shift types assigned to absence shifts are named after the Persionio absence type name (full or half day), or called Personio (hourly) . What Personio absence types are imported? Approved  absences of the type daily, half-daily or hourly can be imported. What happens, if employees already have assigned shifts that the absence interferes with? If the absence is day based, the shift would be assigned the Shift type for the absence. If the absence is hourly, the import will create an additional shift (with the Shift type for absence) additionally to the one already existing. What happens if changes to already imported absence data is made in Personio? If the option  Import current and future absence data  is enabled in the integration setup, the shift in Planday that represents the absence will be updated or deleted during the automatic sync at 11 pm.

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago The Planday + Xero authentication feature allows you to sign up to Planday using your Xero credentials from the Xero App Store. This also allows you to keep using your Xero credentials to sign in to Planday without the need to create any new usernames. Single Authentication The single sign-up process will automatically connect your Xero integration within Planday to the Xero organisation with which you created your Planday portal. This means that once your Planday portal has been created, you can simply navigate to your portal Settings > Integrations > Xero > press Add and start the process of syncing your employee details* from Xero into Planday, as well as set up your payroll so you can send your employees worked hours from Planday into Xero. If your username in Planday matches your credentials/username in Xero, you will also be able to use Xero Single Sign On (SSO)** to sign in to Planday using your Xero credentials from now on.  Permissions Please, note that to be able to  sign up  to Planday using your Xero credentials, you‚Äôll need to at least have  Subscriber permissions in Xero . To be able to  set up  your Xero integration in Planday, you‚Äôll need to have  Payroll administrator rights in Xero .  If you do not have Subscriber permissions, you will not be able to continue with the process of creating a new Planday portal. For Payroll administrator permissions, you will need to ensure you give yourself this permission in Xero if you are a Subscriber. Alternately you can add your Payroll administrator as a user in Planday matching the same Xero credentials (Email address) and re-sync so they can set up your Xero payroll integration. To re-sync your integration go to Settings > Integrations > Xero press Add and then disconnect and reconnect to your Xero organisation.

You can also import payslips from Datev Lohn und Gehalt and make them available for employees in Planday. Follow the steps below to learn how you can use Datev Lohn und Gehalt together with Planday. Setup and activate Datev Lohn und Gehalt Initially, you must import an .INI file into your Datev Lohn und Gehalt account, so the system can recognise the format from when importing payroll reports from Planday. üí°Contact Planday support and we will send you the .INI file. Log in to your Datev Lohn und Gehalt account New format for the transaction data in Lohn und Gehalt with the menu option: Extras | ASCII-Import-Assistent and apply. Import INI-data using the Importieren button.   In Planday you must configure the payroll export format before you can generate the reports. Log into Planday and go to  Settings > Integrations > Overview . Find Datev Lohn und Gehalt and press  Add .   Enter the following settings: Berater nummer ‚Äì find the berater number in Datev Lohn und Gehalt or get the information from your accountant. Mandanten nummer ‚Äì Find the mandanten number in Datev Lohn und Gehalt or get the information from your accountant. Kostentr√§ger ‚Äì normally a 5-digit number in Datev Lohn und Gehalt, which indicates the cost as a salary. When all settings are entered click  Activate .   Apply salary identifiers and salary codes in Planday To ensure correct payroll output from Planday, you need to apply salary identifiers and salary codes from Datev Lohn und Gehalt in Planday so that they are identical in both systems.    Salary identifiers Update each employee with the unique salary identifier in People > Edit employee, and enter the Salary identifier under Payroll.     Salary codes Update Planday with Salary codes from Datev Lohn und Gehalt so it can identify whether the data in the export file should be counted as normal hours, extra hours, or a payroll supplement.    First, enter the salary code for normal worked hours and monthly salary in  Settings  >  Payroll  >  General  >  Salary codes .   To apply salary codes for payroll supplements, create the payroll supplements and then add the salary code. Create the payroll supplements under  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplements . When creating or editing the supplements you will be given the option to enter the specific salary code.   If you are using Planday to register alternate Shift types such as illness, you can also apply salary codes to that specific shift type. Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types  and edit the shift type you want to apply the salary code to.   Finally, if you want to separate the hours between different employee groups for the employees payroll, you can apply specific salary codes to different employee groups. Go to People > Employee groups, select the Edit button and enter the salary code for the group. The salary code for the Employee group will then overwrite the salary code for normal worked hours.   You can learn more about preparing for payroll  here .   Before exporting the payroll export file, remember to check up on approved shifts.   Export Datev Lohn und Gehalt reports in Planday Go to  Payroll > Payroll export . Choose date interval. Choose between all employees or only specific employee groups or employees.

Once complete, your employees can clock in and out from Tevalis, and their clock entries will appear directly in Planday's Punch Clock. Clock times with a start and end time are automatically fetched by Planday every 5 min for the past 48 hours.    Clock times will be visible directly on the shift or inside the Punch Clock menu in  Schedule  >  Punch Clock . If there is a note attached in Tevalis, it will appear as a comment in Planday with the header: Tevalis integration.   Preparing the integration Centralised users The integration requires that you use Centralised users in Tevalis so that users can be mapped between the systems. This means that your users must be managed in the centralised manager application in Tevalis. This is a prerequisite to identifying the user's clock entries from Tevalis and matching them to the correct shifts in Planday.   After the integration is launched your employees will be managed in Planday and their details exported to Tevalis. The following information will be exported: First name Last name Employee group   Request details from Tevalis Before you can set up the integration, contact Tevalis support to request the following details: Your Tevalis Company ID Your Tevalis Secret Your Tevalis Secret 2 If you are not provided with two different secrets, please make a request to Tevalis support to have their API team create the Tevalis Secret 2.   The next step is to verify that existing users have identical names in both Tevalis and Planday.   If you are already a Planday and Tevalis customer and have your users created in both systems, you need to make an initial sync of existing employees. This will provide the users in Tevalis with an external ID from Planday, so Planday can recognise the users in Tevalis.     Activate the Tevalis integration Connect to Tevalis üí° If you have several Planday organizations, you can only connect one Tevalis account to one Planday organization. Connecting the same Tevalis account to different Planday organisations will disconnect it.   Log into Planday and go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview . Find the Tevalis integration in the Time & Attendance category and select  Add . Enter the company ID and both of the secrets which you received from Tevalis support. Press  connect . If the connection fails, please check that you have entered the correct connection details from Tevalis. Next, turn on Push employee data and Tevalis Time Clock   Export of existing employees If you already have users in Planday and Tevalis you can make an initial mapping of these users with the following steps.   On the integrations, page open the Tevalis Time & Attendance integration with the Manage button. Next, select Show details and you will see a list of your employees. Select each Employee group that you want sent to Tevalis. Please note that the Planday Employee groups will overwrite existing groups in Tevalis. Finally, select the Push now button to export the users to Tevalis. Users that already exist in Tevalis will be updated with the Employee group and external ID. Employees that do not yet exist in Tevalis will be created.   New employees Going forward, new employees only need to be created in Planday. Then, instead of also creating the same user in Tevalis, you will simply go to the Tevalis Time and Attendance integration on the integrations page in Planday and select the Employee group the new employee is in. Here you can use the Push now button to add them to Tevalis.     Start using the time clock integration Importing Tevalis clock times Now that the integration is connected and your employees are mapped between Planday and Tevalis the integration will start importing clock times from Tevalis. Time clock entries will be imported every 5 minutes for the past 48 hours. Please note that only time clock entries with both a clock in and a clock out time in Tevalis are imported.   Automatic breaks set up in Planday will be applied to shifts with time clock entries imported from Tevalis. Please note:  Manual breaks in Planday will not work with this integration. Please note:  Clock in and out in Tevalis for breaks will not work with this integration. Planday  rounding rules  will be applied to the imported time clock entries from Tevalis when they are matched to a shift in Planday.    How time clock entries from Tevalis are matched to shifts in Planday If you are curious to understand how time clock entries are matched to the specific shifts in Planday, you can review the set of rules that determines this below.   If an employee has 1 shift on a day, the time clock entries are matched to the shift regardless of the difference between the clock times and shift times. If an employee has 2 consecutive shifts on a day (e.g. 8-14 + 14-17) the integration will match both shifts by following: Shift 1: Time in ‚Äì 14 Shift 2: 14 ‚Äì Time out If an employee has 2 non-consecutive shifts on a day, the integration will work as below: If both the clock in/out times have a difference of less than 1 hour, it will match the shifts. If punch in exceeds a 1-hour difference and punch out has less than a 1-hour difference for the shift times, it will match the shift. If the clock in has less than a 1-hour difference and the clock out has more than a 1-hour difference from the shift times, it will match. If both punch in and punch out times exceed an hour difference from shift times, it will NOT match to any shifts. In this case, no time clock entry is imported, and you will have to verify the punch times with the employee and manually update the times in Planday. You're now ready to start using the integration so you can approve shifts when your employees' time clock information from Tevalis arrives in Planday!   Need more help?

Sync employee data This step will enable employee data synchronisation between Planday and Xero. Assuming you have already created employees in either system, this first-time synchronisation will let you combine data from both platforms so any changes in one are reflected in the other. Any subsequent changes to employee data in Planday would be reflected in Xero but not the other way around. The values we sync from Planday to Xero are: First name and Last name E-mail address Birthday Gender Address City Postcode Country ‚ö†Ô∏è  For the sync to be successful, all the fields must be filled in in Planday.

Employee Data mapping If you have multiple departments in Planday, you‚Äôll be asked to select one from the list because the employees must be linked to a department once imported. üí° You can change the department your employees are assigned to or assign them to multiple departments after finishing the integration set-up by navigating to  People > Departments.  Read more about the  structure of Planday  or  how to create or edit Departments here . Click on  Sync  and you will be shown the employees with the same email in both systems. These employees will be automatically matched in both systems, but you will still need to add them to the integration to map them.   Besides automatically mapping employees in both systems, you can add employees created in Planday or Xero to your synchronisation. Some employees may need to be added manually if they don't have a matching email address. Press the  Add employees  button to manually select employees that should be added to the synchronisation.   Here you can manually select employees from Planday or Xero and add them to the synchronisation. Some of the employees may appear greyed out. This indicates that some information is missing in the employee's profile. Hover your mouse over the greyed-out checkbox to see what information is missing and update it in the employee's Personal details page.

Not what you‚Äôre looking for? Read about our Hogia schedule report and payroll reports to Hogia L√∂n  here  and Hogia L√∂n Plus  here . Follow the steps below to download an export file with Personal and Employment Data in the correct format specified by Hogia. By importing the report in Hogia, you automatically create and update employee entries in Hogia with just a few clicks, so that you only need to make manual updates in Planday. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Important! Before you begin, please note: You must make sure that the salary identifiers in Planday match with the salary identifiers (Anst√§llningsnummer) in Hogia. You can edit salary identifiers in Planday by going to People > Employees, select the pencil icon to edit one employee, or select the employee and click the Edit button. Here, you‚Äôll find the field Salary identifier under Payroll. If you wish to include Swedish social security numbers, you must make sure that they are entered in the correct format in Planday. The format which is accepted by Hogia is YYMMDD-xxxx, in which YY are the two last digits of the birth year (e.g. 89,  not  1989), MM is the month with two digits (e.g 04 for April) and DD is the date (e.g. 01) with two digits and xxxx are the four last digits of the social security number. If you wish to include pay in the file, make sure that Planday is updated with accurate pay rates.   1 - Activate and configure the settings   In  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview , open the Hogia integration editor. If it is already active, you need to select  Manage , if it is not active you will select  Add . Under ‚ÄúPersonal and employment data report‚Äù click on the toggle to enable this report. Then select  Show details  on the right-hand side of the header to open up the advanced editor. Under  Field , you may change the standard setup for the Planday fields you wish to export employee data. We recommend using the default fields as we have set these up based on the file specifications from Hogia. If you do not wish to use one of the fields, simply select  Blank field  in the drop-down list. Scroll down in the advanced editor on the right-hand side to see additional buttons. Select  Add personal pay field  if you wish to add pay related fields to the report. You can select up to three. Each of these must correspond to one of the 25 pay fields in Hogia. If you are using the standard setup in Hogia, we recommend that you map the Planday fields below.  Please make sure to double-check that the personal pay fields in Hogia are set up correctly, and adjust the settings in Planday if necessary:  - ‚ÄúHourly rate‚Äù to ‚ÄúPersonligt_l√∂nef√§lt_3‚Äù  - ‚ÄúMonthly salary‚Äù to ‚ÄúPersonligt_l√∂nef√§lt_1‚Äù.  In addition, you may want to add your custom field for contracted hours per week, if you have this, to ‚ÄúPersonligt_l√∂nef√§lt_8‚Äù. If you want to restore the default field mapping suggestions, at any time, you may click the  Reset to default  button on the bottom right. This will reset the fields to the standard. Click the  Activate  button at the bottom left (if your integration was not active yet). Remember to click ‚ÄùSave‚Äú if the integration was already active. 2 - Create your own report First, you will create your own report(s) based on the template for Hogia. You can name them what you would like and use different filters. Go to  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Export data Under  Integration templates , find the template with the Hogia logo and select  Create report. Give your report a name, and select which Departments and Employee types you wish to include. Under  Filter , you can select to include only newly created, updated, deactivated, or hired employees. The filters are optional. Click  Save . Repeat, if needed. 3 - Download your report When ready to download your Hogia personal and employment data reports, just go to  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Export data . To the left, under  Your employee reports , find the report you want to download. To make sure the report is in the correct format, you should see a small Hogia logo in the top right corner next to the name of the report, as shown in the screenshot below. If you are using the filters, you need to add from and to dates by clicking ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù and selecting dates at the bottom. This is to specify the date range for the user creations, changes, hire dates, or deactivation dates to have occurred, for them to be included in this report download. Select  Download , when ready. Your file will be downloaded onto your computer, and you should be able to find it in the location for your downloaded files. If you need to search for the file, please look for a file name that starts with  Hogia_ .   4 - Import the file in Hogia Before you start this step, please be aware that by importing the report Hogia will automatically create new, update, or deactivate employee data in Hogia, based on the data that is in the file. You can open up the file on a text editor to check its content if you are unsure what data is included. If you have questions about how this works, please see the  Frequently Asked Questions  below. When you are ready, follow the steps below: In Hogia, go to  Arkiv  >  Import  >  Anst√§llda  to begin the import. Then select the file that you downloaded from Planday. Please see the full instructions provided by Hogia Help Center (Swedish)  https://www.kundtorg.hogia.se/fraga?id=6256   Frequently Asked Questions Will new employees in Planday, automatically be created in Hogia? Yes, if the file includes a salary identifier that does not exist in Hogia yet, a new employee entry will be created in Hogia. So when you create the new employees in Planday, make sure you give them a salary identifier that does not exist yet.   What will happen if I have updated an employee‚Äôs data in Planday? If the salary identifier of the employee already exists in Hogia, any changes to any of the employee fields will overwrite data in the respective fields in Hogia.   What will happen if I have deactivated an employee in Planday? If you have set a deactivation date for an employee in Planday, the employee will become inactive in Hogia on the specified date. This is because the import will make sure that the field ‚ÄúAvg√•ngsdatum‚Äù in Hogia is updated with the new date.   Why is the hourly rate field not updated? Firstly, double-check that you have selected the hourly rate field and saved the integration settings correctly, as shown in this guide. Secondly, please check that the employee has a valid hourly rate in Planday in People > Employees > Edit (select the pencil icon to edit one employee or select the employee and click the Edit button) > Groups and Wages. The valid from date on the hourly rate should not be in the future. Also, if the employee has several employee groups, the hourly rate for one employee must be identical in all their groups. If an employee has different rates in Planday, this field will be blank in the file for this employee.    What data does the ‚ÄúFull Bank Account‚Äù field include? This includes both the Reg Num (Sweden: Clearing number) and the account number. If you select the Bank Account field instead, this will not include the Reg Num (Sweden: Clearing number).   Can I add additional fields to the report? You can add up to 3 additional pay fields. Other fields are not supported at this time.   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate Fortnox with Planday. Set up Planday with Fortnox here  or see  Fortnox - FAQ and troubleshooting  guide. With the successful  integration of Fortnox , it is essential to maintain accurate and up-to-date employee and payroll information in both Planday and Fortnox. This article provides a comprehensive guide on effectively managing payroll, previewing payroll data, and synchronising it seamlessly with Fortnox. Managing payroll sync Settings checklist before you do a pay run To preview and send payroll data to Fortnox, you must ensure that the Fortnox  Cause codes   and   Planday   Salary codes  are linked. We recommend that you follow this settings checklist to make sure everything is in place. ‚ö†Ô∏è  When migrating from an existing integration based on export files You can skip this step if you are migrating from an integration based on PAXml file export/import to a setup not based on export files. Ensure that all the pay items are supported in the new integration. For instance, the OK0 (NV9 in PAXml file), OK1 (√ñK1 in PAXml file), and OK2 (√ñK2 in PAXml file) codes are different in the current configuration. If your employees are hourly paid, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  General  and check that the  Salary code  for  Hours worked (as per shifts)  field is set to  ARB .  If your employees are paid according to the number of hours from Approved Punch Clock entries:  make sure that you've  approved all the necessary Punch Clock entries  from  Schedule  >  Punch Clock  and that all shifts that you want to include in the payroll are approved (marked as green on your schedule). Note that by default, only approved hours are included in payroll reports. If your employees get a monthly salary , you must ensure that the worked hours from the schedule are excluded from their payroll calculations. To check whether the hours are already excluded, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Prints  and under  Ignore salary codes  check whether the Salary code for the monthly salaries is already on the list. You can add it from the  Create  button if it doesn't already exist.  Then, you will need to make sure that the newly created Salary code is attached to the profiles of your salary (monthly) paid employees. From  People  >  Employees  >  Edit employee  (‚úèÔ∏è icon on the right side of the screen) >  Employment  >  Employee group s >  Edit .   Here, you'll need to add the new Salary code to each employee group that your employee belongs to and select a date from when the code is valid on their profile (you should choose a date that is before the first pay run for the integration) and leave/set the Wage (hourly rate) as 0. Payroll supplements for unsociable hours If your organisation has a schedule that includes unsociable hours with payroll implications, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplements  and make sure that each supplement has the right Salary code set (e.g. OB1, OB2, OB3, etc).   Under  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Meal deductions and contributions,  check or add the Salary code  322  for deductions and  32  for contributions.  Additionally, make sure that the meal deductions have a positive value output Verify that your Shift types have the correct Cause codes attached from  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types  (e.g. SJK, VAB). Sync data into Fortnox cost centres If you wish to sync your labour costs to Fortnox with cost centre allocation, you must map your departments to relevant cost centres and then enable the functionality.    Start by enabling the cost centre functionality in the Fortnox integration. To enable the feature, navigate to  Settings  in Planday > click  Integrations  > open the  Fortnox  integration and select the  Include department number (Fortnox cost center)  checkbox.   Then copy-paste codes of your cost centres to corresponding departments in Planday (use the  Department number field ).   Preview Payroll data before syncing You can generate a payroll preview and synchronise your records (from Planday to Fortnox) for worked hours, overtime, absence, and supplements from  Payroll  >  Fortnox . Here, you can prepare and filter the data you want to preview or sync between the two systems through options available at the top of the screen: Fortnox account:  select one of your connected Fortnox accounts to sync payroll data to. Date range:  select the period for the pay run by selecting a date range. Department : select which Planday Department to gather payroll data for. Shifts:  select which shifts from the Schedule you'd like to preview or sync data for: only  Approved  Shifts (selected default and recommended when sync√≠ng payroll data),  only those not approved  or all Shifts from the selected date range. Employee type & Employee group:  this allows you to choose and filter which employee data to include using filters for Employee type and Employee group.  If necessary, you can select or deselect individual employees from both dropdown menus to filter for a single employee. Once you're satisfied with your selection, you can preview your data as a report from the top right corner (Preview report). This will   generate a report containing the data according to your filters and conditions for you to verify and sync. You cannot sync the selected data without first previewing it. When the report is ready, you can see an overview of your data, containing: the  names  of your employees (as registered in Planday), their  salary IDs  (equivalent of their employee ID in Fortnox), the number of worked  hours  (within the date range selected and according to the Shifts included).  For monthly paid employees this will show the number of hours recorded through special shift types ( e.g. overtime). total : showing as an  estimated pay  for hourly-paid employees  or  the  estimated differences  from the regular salary for monthly-paid employees (e.g. overtime, deductions, etc). For each Employee on the list, you can click on their entry in the overview list to see a brief breakdown of their recorded  hours  per shift type, and of their  total  per supplement and deduction type. You also have the option to check the data more thoroughly from Show details, which will give you a full picture of the payroll data: grouped by  Date : showing shifts - including breaks, supplements, and deductions related to that shift; and their start and end times, where applicable. Position:  highlighting   the Schedule Position of the shift, if applicable or name/details for breaks, supplements, and deductions. Quantity : showing the number of hours (except for daily supplements or deductions) Wage / Pay rate:  the rate per hour for shifts and hourly supplements or the rate per day for daily supplements or deductions Total:  the resulting monetary impact of the shift, break, supplement or deduction according to its set rate.   üí° In case you do not see certain shifts, shift types or supplements added to the preview, please review previous steps regarding updating salary codes or see  How to set up Salary codes in Planday .   Sync payroll data to Fortnox Once you've previewed and verified that the data is correct, press  Sync report  from the top right corner.   This will start cleaning up the payroll data from Fortnox (if there is any existing data for the selected date range) and transferring the selected data to Fortnox.  Depending on the amount of data in your report, this process can take a few moments.   Once the process is complete, you will get a confirmation message under  Sync status.  If you encounter any errors during the sync process, you will see a message about what went wrong. Double-check your data or follow the instructions on troubleshooting in this  Fortnox - FAQ and troubleshooting  article.   Need more help?

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series) with Planday. This integration is only available for customers based in the UK, Germany, the USA and France. With Planday, you can connect your Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series - formerly iKentoo) POS system and automatically import sales data. This lets you compare your revenue vs payroll costs and helps you plan your schedules to align with the budget. You can connect different K-Series Business Locations with Planday Revenue units. Follow this setup guide to configure the integration. Requirements for the integration For this integration to work, you must complete two prerequisites in Planday.     1. Set up Revenue units in Planday To get this integration working, you must map Planday‚Äôs Revenue units with Lightspeed‚Äôs Registers/Outlets to fetch revenue data.   Before setting up the integration, create at least one  Revenue unit  in every  Department  where you wish to import revenue.  To set up a Revenue unit in Planday, go to  Settings  > under the  Reports  heading, press  Revenue  >  Create. üí° You can create several revenue units within a department   When setting up a Revenue unit, select the option to  Enter daily revenue  for every unit you want to map, along with selecting  Include in total revenue,  as shown in the screenshot below.   üí°  For detailed steps, read the  Revenue in Planday  article.     2. Create Shifts on business days where revenue should be imported Revenue can only be imported into the business days of your schedule. To create a business day in your schedule, ensure that there is at least one  Shift  for the given day where you wish to import revenue.  Set up the integration in Planday Follow these steps to find, connect and configure the integration.    Find and connect the integration Once the prerequisites have been completed, go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview.  Switch to the  Point of Sale  tab to see all available POS integrations or search for the integration name from the search bar.      Click  Connect  on the  Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series)  tile to start setting up the integration.   Connect Lightspeed account Connect one or more Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series)  Accounts  by pressing the  Connect account  button. This will redirect you to a Lightspeed sign-in page. You must enter your email and password here. After signing in, you will then be redirected back to Planday in  Settings > Integrations > Overview . Locate the Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series) and click on  Connect  again. The green  status  icon üü¢ will inform you that the connection is set up correctly.  üí°  In case of issues with the connection, a dedicated status message and light will be displayed in front of the account. You can click on the status to read more or take further action if required. Configure data import settings When at least one account is connected successfully, complete the integration setup by specifying other settings and mappings.  Overwrite existing data -  Select this option if the integration should overwrite the existing figures in Planday. This should be selected if the budgeted revenue is entered manually in the revenue report, or if the days being fetched have had any changes or updates made to the revenue figures in Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series). Import revenue data  Incl. tax / Excl. tax : Select whether or not you want to include or exclude VAT in the revenue imported from Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series). Incl. Service charge / Excl. Service charge : Choose whether or not you want to include or exclude the service charge you‚Äôve set up in Lightspeed.   üí° The product type ‚Äúservice charge‚Äù (usually 12.5% of the revenue corresponding to the tips) will need to be created  in Lightspeed first. Link Planday Revenue units with Lightspeed Business Locations üí°  At least  one Revenue unit in Planday  is required for this step. Over to the right, you should see an overview of the Revenue units created for your business in Planday. In the dropdown next to the name of each Revenue unit, choose the corresponding Business Locations in Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series), so that the revenue from the selected business locations is imported into the correct departments in Planday in order to calculate accurate labour percentages.    üí° It‚Äôs a good idea to have a one-to-one mapping between Business Locations (sales areas) and revenue units so you can quickly review individual revenue numbers.   Activate the integration Lastly, select  Activate  at the bottom of your screen. Now the integration will start importing your revenue data into the corresponding revenue units automatically from Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series). Import historical revenue on-demand (optional) The integration to Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series) allows you to import your daily revenue data from up to 30 days back in time. You would want to do this, for example, to view revenue compared to labour costs in Planday for the entire payroll period that you are currently in. This step is optional. The integration will start pulling data from Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series)  every 5 minutes  from the date on which you activated the integration. You can also check back anytime if you wish to use the on-demand import function at a later date. üí°  Before you start make sure you have completed the mapping of your Planday revenue units to your Business locations in Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series) and have activated the integration. To do an import of historical revenue, follow the steps below.  In  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview , find the Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series) integration and select  Manage Under the section  Import historical revenue , select the number of days in the past you wish to fetch daily revenue data from and select Import.

Click  Save  to exit   See the imported values To verify in Planday : Open the Schedule page on Planday. Press the  View settings  button, and turn on the Revenue toggle to reveal earnings values at the bottom of each business day. Revenue imported for a given Revenue unit is displayed in the Daily revenue pop-up.   Or you can go to  Reports  >  Revenue > Per day  in the top menu and click on the daily revenue link where the same daily revenue pop-up will show. üí°  You can check the source of the revenue data in the  Notes  of the Daily Revenue   üí°  Be aware that the Notes field contains the timestamp of the revenue import and a label of the revenue source. The shown timestamp reflects the UCT time zone and is not adjusted for your Planday organisation‚Äôs location. To Verify in Lightspeed : The data in K-Series can be checked from your Lightspeed dashboard under  Reports > Transactions.   Revenue import details Integration timing The integration imports revenue data from Lightspeed every 5 minutes. Include or exclude tax values By default, the integration imports Gross values from mapped locations. To import Net values, uncheck the  Incl. tax  option. Revenue value The imported revenue is the sum of the revenue values of all active Business Locations mapped to the Revenue unit from successfully connected Lightspeed accounts. If any Lightspeed account connection does not work, revenue from the Account‚Äôs Business Locations will not count in the revenue imported into the mapped Revenue units. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Note that incomplete revenue values will overwrite correct values imported in the past if a Lightspeed account connection stops working and if you are importing values for several days in the past. FAQs and troubleshooting How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, you can remove individual connected Lightspeed accounts by clicking on  Manage  on the integration‚Äôs tile, and then on  Disconnect . This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be overwritten. Alternatively, from the same window, click on  Deactivate . Revenue is not importing Ensure that there is at least one Shift on the Schedule for each day where revenue should be imported.  Ensure that the Enter daily revenue checkbox, located in  Settings > Revenue , is selected for mapped revenue units.  Verify that Lightspeed Restaurant K-Series Business Locations are mapped to the Revenue units of the relevant Departments.   The account needs to be reconnected In some instances, authorisation to the connected account can fail, and the account will need to be reconnected. You can see the current status of the connected accounts displayed next to the corresponding account when you open the integration tile. To reconnect the account, you must click on the  Manage  button in the Integration tile and then on  Disconnect .  Click on the  Connect Account  button and a pop-up window asking you to sign in again will appear. Once you sign in, the connection status will be updated. ‚ö†Ô∏è  When an account needs to be reconnected, its revenue will not be imported into Planday, meaning that you might notice unusually low revenue shown in the Schedule. To remedy this, click on the  Import now  button in the Import historical revenue section in the Lightspeed K-Series integration settings. Can I connect several Lightspeed accounts to the same Planday organisation? Yes, it's possible. To add another Lightspeed account to your Planday,  go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  find the relevant Lightspeed integration tile and click on  Connect click on  Connect account  and add the details of that second connection Then, you can link the relevant revenue units ( corresponding to the departments) to the relevant Business locations.

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For advanced admins. Familiarise yourself with the  Payroll and Revenue  collection of articles. What are Salary codes? Salary codes  in Planday are used to identify and report different shifts, mainly when you use accounting software to process your payroll. They help categorise the shifts and make managing and tracking payroll-related information easier. For example, you can use salary codes to differentiate regular working hours, overtime, sick leave, or any other specific types of shifts for accurate reporting and payroll calculations. When and where can you use Salary codes Salary codes have a hierarchy when placed in different areas of Planday. A general Salary code can be set for all normal Shifts that cover all the hours. This is sufficient under most circumstances.   A Salary code can also be set for each  Employee group . This will overrule the general code to differentiate Shifts belonging to that Employee group.   In rare cases, a Salary code can also be set on each employee's wage. This will overrule the general one and the one set on the Employee group level. üí°  Please keep Salary codes simple and avoid using special characters or punctuation marks, as that may interfere with your payroll integration service. You may use alphanumeric names, for example, Under18 or Full-time, but avoid using complex characters such !partTime&(u18*) ‚Ç¨FullTimer%100Pay. How to set a general Salary code You can set up a general   Salary code for all normal shifts simply by going to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  General.  Scroll down to the  Salary codes  section and set values for regular hourly worked shifts, monthly salaried shifts, or employee purchases.   üí°   If no value has been inserted in the fields above, the default salary code for Hours worked (as per shifts) is 1201 and for Salary, it‚Äôs 1202. These would show in the payroll report. How to set a Salary code on Shift types Another place you can assign Salary codes is on specific  Shift types . This is helpful when you want to distinguish hours as overtime, unpaid leave, sick, or absence.    Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types,  click on an existing Shift type to  edit  and add a Salary code to override the one set in general settings.   In the following example, you can see that all Shifts marked with overtime of 1.5x will be reported under Salary code 1500 so that the payroll software can distinguish those hours from the regular hours. üí° Note that Planday only reports the hours for that Shift type, not the rate. Apply Salary codes to Employee groups Setting up Salary codes for  Employee groups  can be helpful if you want to differentiate the hours for a group of employees or job roles. For example, employees in a clinic need to be paid a different wage than when they work in the reception vs other administrative roles. You could set a Salary code for the Employee group to differentiate Shifts belonging to these employees.   Go to  People  >  Employee groups.  You can add a Salary code to a new group or edit an existing one. The Salary codes set here will override the one set in the  g eneral settings.   Assign a Salary code to an employee There might be situations where you need to differentiate a single employee's hours separate from the rest of the group. For example, an employee may be paid a different rate due to their seniority in the company, so their hours need to be reported separately in payroll. Setting an individual salary code for this employee would be the way to go, so it overrides the general Salary code and any of the group rates. Go to  People  >  Employees  > click the  edit  employee button on an employee you wish to change > switch to the  Employment  tab > scroll down to  Employee groups  >  Edit . You can assign a personal Salary code to this employee by editing their Employee group relation. üí° For scalability, we generally don't recommend applying a Salary code on the employee level but use it through  Employee groups  instead.

If you select Friday at 7am as an import day, Planday will import the revenue data for selected days back in time on Friday at 7am. If an import day reimports revenue data for days already imported to Planday, the existing data will be overwritten by the most recent import for revenue data reporting on those days. After adding the days and time, follow the below steps to complete the connection to Lighspeed (G-Series) the dropdown menu labelled POS service, and select Lightspeed Restaurant POS (G-Series).

QuickBooks PaySuite is no longer supported.   Activate the integration to QuickBooks Online Log into Planday and go to the integrations page via  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview . Find QuickBooks Online and select Add to set it up.     Connect to your QuickBooks Online account Start setting up the integration by selecting Connect to QuickBooks. This will redirect you to QuickBooks Online, where you will need to authorise the integration. If you are already logged into QuickBooks Online, you can go ahead and authorise the integration to Planday. If you are not logged in, you must first log in to QuickBooks to authorise access to Planday. Once you have authorised access, you will be redirected back to the Planday integration page. Select the Add button on the QuickBooks Online tile to verify the systems are successfully connected. From there, toggle on the features which should be available for the integration (Employee details and/or Worked hours).   Select Activate to launch the integration of QuickBooks Online and Planday.     Synchronise existing employees Once the integration is activated using the above steps, you can synchronise your existing employees between Planday and QuickBooks Online.   Prepare the employee synchronisation An important step is to revise one of QuickBooks Online's settings to prevent all inactive employees in QuickBooks Online from being exported to Planday. To do this, log in to QuickBooks Online and edit an inactive employee, then deselect the option Show in non-payroll list in the Employment section. This step should be carried out for each inactive employee. Next, enter employee address information in Planday.   When QuickBooks Payroll is enabled on your QuickBooks Online account, ensure that the fields City, Postal Code, and State are entered for every employee. If this information is not entered, the employee will not be exported to QuickBooks Online when you activate the integration.     Synchronise existing employees On the QuickBooks Online integration tile in Planday, select Manage, then select Show details under the Employee details section. Select which department employees imported from QuickBooks Online should be assigned to. When a new employee is created in Planday, you can edit the employee and modify which Departments they are in. Before synchronising your employees, ensure their names and emails are identical in both systems to avoid creating duplicates. Lastly, select Sync Employees Now. The integration will now update and link employees across QuickBooks Online and Planday. Create new employees With the integration setup, you can create new users or employees in either system and they will automatically be synchronised to the other.     Create new employees in Planday When you create new employees in Planday they will automatically be created in QuickBooks Online with the following details: Given name Family name E-mail Mobile / Primary phone Address (city, postal code and state is required when QuickBooks Payroll is enabled) Birthdate Gender Hired date ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note:  Contact info public  needs to be ticked in Planday for employees to be automatically created in QuickBooks Online. See the article on  Employee information: visibility and access settings .   Create new employees in QuickBooks Online You can also create new employees in QuickBooks Online and they will automatically be created in Planday. They will be created in Planday with the same details as above.   Creating employees from QuickBooks Online requires that you have selected a default Planday department that new employees will be assigned to. To do so go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  >  QuickBooks Online  >  Employee details  >  Show details  >  Select department . When creating employees from QuickBooks Online please be aware that there is a 5 min processing time, before the employee will be exported from QuickBooks Online.     Send Welcome notification When employees are created from QuickBooks Online you can have Planday send them a welcome notification that contains the relevant Planday info. To do so, go to  People  >  Employees  > Select employee > Click on the  Invite employee icon .     Export worked hours Prepare the automatic export of worked hours To automatically export worked hours from Planday to QuickBooks, toggle on Export Worked Hours in the QuickBooks Online integration configuration via  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  >  QuickBooks Online  >  Worked Hours  >  Export Worked Hour s. The integration will send all worked hours from normal shifts by default. If you also want hours from a specific Shift type to be exported to QuickBooks Online, you can select the relevant Shift types in the QuickBooks Online integration configuration. To do so, go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  >  QuickBooks Online  >  Worked Hours  >  Show details  >  Add shift types .     Export worked hours When a shift in Planday is approved, the worked hours will automatically be exported to QuickBooks Online as a time activity.   The integration supports Break rules in Planday, and only the worked hours will be exported (break times will not be exported).   Unapprove or delete shifts If a shift is already approved and the worked hours have been exported to QuickBooks Online, you can remove the worked hours from QuickBooks Online by marking the shift as Not approved in Planday, or by deleting the shift in Planday. After doing this, the integration will automatically remove the time activity from the weekly timesheet in QuickBooks Online.   Syncing leave data with QuickBooks Planday integration with QuickBooks does not directly support synchronising of leave as a feature. You can get around this by transferring leave data by utilising Shift types on your schedule. For guidance, please see this article on  How to use absence with payroll integration . Need more help?

On the Starter plan, you are limited to having 1 Department, while the Plus and Pro plans allow up to 5 or more Departments. When in doubt, check with the Planday support team. If necessary, upgrade to a plan that allows enough Departments. Departments that would go over the limit and employees assigned to it will not be created in the import.   How are employees assigned to Departments in the import? You define in the integration setup, which of your Personio entities  should correlate to a Planday Department . In the import, employees will be added to Planday Departments as follows: If there are Departments with matching names, employees will be added to them. In that case, your total number of Departments would be unaffected. If there is no Department with a matching name, the system will try to add Departments named after the Personio entity. This would affect your total number of Departments. If you import employees from Personio with no value in the required field, they will be assigned to a newly created fallback Department called  Personio . This would affect your total number of Departments.   How do I ensure an uninterrupted, complete import of employees? When applicable, match the name of a Planday Department with the name of the Personio entity you want to have connected to it. In Personio, check the number of entities that would be imported by going to  Settings  >  Organization . Consult Planday‚Äôs support team to make sure you know your maximum number of allowed Departments. If necessary, upgrade to another plan. Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  This integration is for Planday admins based in Australia, the UK and the USA only. With Planday you can connect your  Square  merchant accounts and automatically import revenue data from different Square Locations into Planday Revenue units. Requirements for the integration For this integration to work, two prerequisites in Planday must be completed.   Setup Revenue units in Planday To get this integration working, you must map Planday‚Äôs Revenue units with Square‚Äôs Locations to fetch revenue data. Before setting up the integration, create at least one Revenue unit in every Department where you wish to import revenue.  To set up a revenue unit in Planday, go to  Settings  > Under the  Reports  heading, press  Revenue  >  Create. When setting up a Revenue unit, make sure to select  Enter daily revenue  for every unit you want to map and also select  Include in total revenue .   üí° For detailed steps, use the  Revenue in Planday  article.   Create Shifts on business days where revenue should be imported Revenue can only be imported into business days of your schedule. To create a business day in your schedule, make sure to schedule at least one Shift for the given day. Setup the integration in Planday Follow these steps to find, connect and configure the integration.   Find and connect the integration Once the prerequisites have been completed, go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview.  Switch to the  Point of Sale  tab to see all available POS integrations or search for the integration name from the search bar.    Click  Connect  on the Square tile to open the integration editor. During this step, the integration gains access to Planday data.   Connect new merchant Connect one or more Square  merchants  (i.e., Square accounts) in the first card in the integration editor.   To connect a Square account, click the  Connect merchant  button, which will open a Square log-in screen in a new window. ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your browser is not blocking pop-up windows, in which case the Square log-in window will not open. After signing in, check the Merchants table, which shows your newly connected account. The green status icon will inform you that the connection is set up correctly.   In case of issues with the Square account connection, a dedicated status and an orange status light will be displayed in the table.   Data import settings When at least one merchant is connected successfully, you can complete the integration setup by specifying other settings and mappings.  Start import at  -  Choose an hour.  The integration imports revenue once daily at the hour specified in the  Start import at  field. The imports will take place within the specified hour, typically close to the start of the hour. Get data from the past  -  Choose the number of days.  This field allows you to specify how many days worth of data should be imported. The minimum number of days is 1, meaning the integration only imports data from the previous day. üí° When selecting more than one day, previously imported revenue on mapped Revenue units is overwritten during every import. It is possible the imported values can change over the first several days as payments get processed on Square‚Äôs side. The integration imports only payments marked as  Complete  in Square.   Map Locations and Revenue units Click the  Link location  button in the Locations card to open the mapping window.  At least one Revenue unit in Planday is required  for this step.   The linking page shows all Revenue units and allows you to select any Square Location to map. It is possible to map multiple Revenue units to one Square location and vice versa.   Click  Save  to accept all changes. Alternatively, close the window or click the Back button to discard the changes.   Revenue Import Details Integration timing The integration imports revenue data from Square once a day. The import takes place within one hour starting at the hour selected in the  Start import at  field.  Typically, the import runs near the beginning of the specified interval.    Tax Always Included Integration always imports Gross value from mapped locations. There is no option to import Net value or get information about Tax level or Tax value separately.  Revenue Value The imported revenue is the sum of revenue values of all active Locations mapped to the Revenue Unit from successfully connected Merchant accounts. If any merchant connection does not work, revenue from the merchant‚Äôs locations will not count in the revenue imported into the mapped Revenue units.   ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that incomplete revenue values will overwrite correct values imported in the past if a Merchant account connection stops working and if you are importing values for several days in the past.   FAQs and troubleshooting Merchant account needs to be reconnected. In some instances, authorization to the connected account can fail, and the account will need to be reconnected. The user will be informed of that state in the Merchants card where such status will be displayed next to the corresponding account. How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, the user must remove all connected merchants. This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be deleted and stays in Planday.  How can I verify imported values? Verify in Planday:  Open the  Schedule  page on Planday. Press the  View settings  button,  turn on the Revenue toggle  to reveal revenue values at the bottom of each Schedule day.   Revenue imported for a given revenue unit is displayed in the  Daily revenue  pop-up. üí° Note that the Notes field contains the timestamp of the revenue import and a label of the revenue source. The shown timestamp reflects the  UCT time zone , and it is not adjusted for your Planday organisation‚Äôs location! Verify in Square:  Open your  Square Seller dashboard   https://squareup.com/dashboard  and log in using the same merchant account you used to connect with Planday. Navigate to  Reporting , then  Transactions .   Set relevant values in the filter: The date should reflect the period you are checking. Set types to  Payments . Set the status to  Complete . Select the location you want to verify. The value you should compare with imported revenue in Planday is shown in the  Total collected  field. Square sign-in window is not showing Make sure that your browser is not blocking pop-up windows. This can often lead to the log-in window not appearing. If possible, try opening Planday on a different browser. Revenue not importing Make sure that there is at least one Shift in the Schedule on each day where revenue should be imported. Ensure that the  Enter daily revenue  checkbox, located in  Settings  >  Revenue , is selected for mapped Revenue units. Verify that Square locations are mapped to Revenue units of relevant Departments in Planday. Merchant account needs to be reconnected If a merchant account needs to be reconnected, the corresponding status will be displayed on the Merchants card. To reconnect the account, you must click on the account‚Äôs table row in the Merchants card. A pop-up window asking you to sign in again will appear. You must log in to the correct Square account. Once you sign in, the connection status will be updated in the table. When an account needs to be reconnected, its revenue will not be imported into Planday, meaning that you might notice unusually low revenue shown on the Schedule. To remedy this, after reconnecting the account, you can increase the number of imported days to overwrite days showing partial revenue figures. Revenue imported to Planday does not match the value reported by Square Check Payments Status  The integration calculates revenue based only on payments marked as  Complete . Since payments can take up to a few days to be processed, it is possible that imported revenue will not correspond to values shown in Square, or that the value shown in Schedule will change during the next import. If you wish to compare values more accurately, filter transactions in Square by the  Completed  status. Check Connection Status  Please check that all connections are in  Connected  status. If a connection doesn‚Äôt work correctly, then Payments related to Locations from this connection will not be imported. Need more help?

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For Planday admins using Xero in the UK. See  Xero Setup instructions here .   Integration setup My organisation is not connected successfully If you have the following message: ‚ÄúYou do not have sufficient payroll permissions‚Äù, it can be caused by two things: You need to ensure that the user who connected the organisation has payroll permissions in Xero and has not been deactivated. It can also be because the Payroll module of your organisation is not set up yet. To fix this, open  Xero.com , navigate to your Xero organisation and click  Payroll > Overview . Visiting this page will initialise the Payroll module and the next time you open the Xero integration in Planday, the status should be updated.   Employee syncing What information is required to add an employee in Planday and Xero? Ensure that the fields listed below are filled in the employee profile in Planday if you wish to sync employee details to Xero. First name and Last name Email address Gender Address Postcode City Date of birth Country The employee data that will be synced is gathered from the fields above. ‚ö†Ô∏è  After the initial sync of your employees , r emember to always create and update employees in Planday, as this is a one-way sync. Some of my employees are not syncing to Xero If you are unable to sync Planday users to your Xero organisation, please check the following: Set up Banking - via Xero Organisation > Accounting > Bank Accounts > Add Bank Account The organisation‚Äôs region is supported by Planday. Currently, Planday only works with Xero organisations in the UK and Australia. The connected organization should be UK-based. Please note that special characters and numbers in the name such as  √¶, √∏, √•, √º  are not currently accepted by Xero. So if you have these special characters as part of your name or address fields, they would need to be changed to their equivalent standard alphabets. Also, ensure that there are no trailing spaces in the synced field values. You might encounter sync errors if any of the following information in employee data is missing: First and Last name Email address Gender Address Postcode City Date of birth Country ‚ö†Ô∏è  Make sure you don't archive any of the fields above for employee sync to work. You can update the missing employee information by navigating to  People > Employees >  Select the  employee  to edit  >  Click on  Edit > Personal details >  Update information . After you have added any missing information, return to the Integrations page and synchronise again. If you do not wish to sync an employee, you can ignore the warnings and continue. What if my employees belong to different Employee groups and have different wages? In this case, Xero will hold the earning rate. Planday will not be sending wage-related payroll data over to Xero.  This means that you'll have to have multiple earning rates set up within Xero, corresponding to each employee group, for each wage variation. You need to do the following:  Create multiple earning rates in Xero for each of your Employee group in Planday Assign a  salary code to each of your Employee group  in Planday Map these salary codes to the earning rates  you created in Xero from the Integrations settings in Planday. I have done the initial sync and have some leavers/deactivated employees still showing up. How can I prevent them from syncing? The first time you sync your employees, you will see deactivated users.  If you do not wish to sync the deactivated users, untick the checkbox next to their name and they won't be synced. What happens with my leavers/deactivated employees? The timesheets hours in that date range will still be sent to Xero. However, you will need to mark the employee as a leaver in Xero and process the last pay run there. Xero will also hold all of the information in regards to paying out or recovering any holiday.   Leave management How will holidays be managed with Planday and Xero UK? üí° Please, note that leave type synchronisation is only currently available for the Australian Xero integration. You need to set up a shift type for Leave and apply a  salary code  to it so that you can map it with the equivalent Xero Leave pay item. You can visit  Setup an employee‚Äôs leave entitlements  on  Xero Central  for information on Leave management in Xero. While you can record your holiday in Planday, we will not be sending leave related payroll data over to Xero. Planday will only send the date range of leave taken to Xero, therefore any payments, balances and accrual will be managed within Xero.  The holiday can be recorded by using shift types in Planday. You can  set up a shift type  in your portal and call it  Holiday - Xero  or use an existing shift type. In Planday you will be using  Fixed Vacation Accounts   or  Accrued Accounts .  Planday will handle the request and schedule of holidays whereas Xero will handle the  payment  and balance of holidays.  For any questions on how to add absence in Xero please contact the Xero support team or your account manager at Xero.   Time & Pay run syncing Are all the hours synced with Xero (including sickness)? In Planday, you‚Äôre only syncing the hours as long as you‚Äôve marked them with a salary code and you‚Äôve matched this salary code with the equivalent Xero pay item in your Xero integration. To sync the normal hours, you can assign a salary code to the shifts if you navigate to  Settings > Payroll > General,  scroll down to  Salary Codes  and enter the code for hourly workers in the  Hours worked (as per shifts)  field. If you‚Äôd like to sync the hours marked by a Shift type and that are related to sickness or overtime for example, you would need to apply a salary code to the shift type and map this salary code with the equivalent pay item in Xero. But if you want to exclude some hours, for example, if you‚Äôre using a shift type for sickness and you don‚Äôt want these hours to be synced to Xero, you can leave the salary code in the shift type blank. Some of my employees are not showing in the payroll preview If you are in  Xero Payroll  in Planday and some of your employees are not showing when you click on  Preview report , it can be because of the following reason: Your employees are assigned  personal Salary codes  which are not mapped with any of your pay items in Xero. To fix this issue, you would need to do the following: either map the personal salary codes with the Xero pay items in the Integration setting in Planday (link to Sync payroll data in Step 2 Final setup) or delete the personal salary codes and map the salary code of the employee group your employees are part of in Planday with the equivalent pay item in Xero. üí°  Please be aware of the following hierarchy when you assign salary codes in Planday: Are the pay rate and bank details updated in Xero? The pay rate and bank details of an employee will need to be maintained in both Planday and Xero. At the moment we are only sending over address and date of birth details to Xero. Why is the minutes count different in Xero from the Planday payroll preview? Time can be expressed either as fractions, decimals or as minutes and hours. To calculate payroll, time needs to be in decimal form so that it can be multiplied by an employee‚Äôs pay rate. Xero is an accounting software and will therefore report in decimal minutes. I can‚Äôt seem to see the correct date range in the Planday pay run You need to ensure that you have created a  draft pay run  setup in Xero before you can see the information in the Planday dropdown. Create a draft pay run by going to  Xero  >  Payroll  >  Pay employees.  Click  Add Pay Run  >   Select a pay period > press  Next.  Read   more  about this at Xero Central . I got an error code stating my employees need calendar IDs setup This means you have no employment record in the Xero setup. This could potentially be a new starter or someone who needs to be added to Xero. Follow the instructions from Xero Central on  Employee is missing from a pay run .   It can also be because some employees are assigned to a different calendar than what the selected pay runs belongs to. Can I redo the hours exported to Xero for some employees? For example, you moved some employees to another employee group, that would thus affect the pay. Say you‚Äôve already transferred the hours attached to the old employee group to Xero and you need to send these hours again. You would need to do the following in Xero: Revert the pay run to draft Remove any existing timesheets in the draft pay run for the specified employees by going to  Payroll  >  Timesheets  >  Select employee  >  Edit  >  Delete Timesheets . Then you can export the hours from Planday to Xero again under  Payroll  >  Xero payroll .   Supported functionalities & limitations Does the integration support tips or service charges? Service charges and tips are usually handled outside of Planday and directly through Xero. However, if you wish to manually enter tips into Planday you can do so by using a manual payroll supplement. You will then need to match the Xero earning rate to the salary code of the payroll supplement in Planday.   In some cases, this can be time-consuming and it may be quicker to manage supplements directly into Xero. Does the integration support my salaried staff? At the moment, the integration supports hourly workers only. Salaried staff in Xero will be paid out the same each pay period so there is no need to send the hours over to Xero. We will still keep the historical shift data on salaried employees in Planday. üí°  This data should not be pushed to Xero, as this will cause the salary to change based on the hours sent over to Xero. Do we support Xero in other countries? At the moment Xero integration with Planday is only supported in the UK and  Australia . What are the supported earning categories and rate types? Xero only allows the following earnings categories and rates for timesheets to be imported through the integration: Earning Categories Regular Earnings Overtime Earnings Rate types Rate per unit (Unit must be set to hours) Rate per hour   Need more help?

Choose if you want the revenue to be displayed including or excluding a service charge (your option is not going to affect the numbers if you don¬¥t use a service charge) Open Location matching by clicking on Show details. Location matching Now, you can connect the Revenue units in Planday to their corresponding Floors in Lightspeed Restaurant (L Series), so the revenue will be imported into the correct departments in Planday and an accurate labor percentage will be calculated.   If you have some of your tables set up to ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù and/or ‚Äútakeaway‚Äù you also need to specify to which revenue unit these types should be imported to. Please note that revenue from ‚ÄúTakeaway Simple‚Äù will be calculated as a part of the floor and only revenue from the table types ‚Äútakeaway‚Äù or ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù will go into the separate delivery and takeaway mapping.   Here you will see all of the Revenue units created for your business in Planday. In the dropdown menu next to the name of each Revenue unit, choose the corresponding Floor from Lightspeed Restaurant (L Series). Select the revenue unit you want to import the revenue from Delivery to. Do the same for revenue from Takeaway. It is possible to leave this blank or select revenue units that are already mapped. In this case, the revenue from all selections will be imported to the same revenue unit. Select Activate. Now the integration will start importing your revenue data from Lightspeed Restaurant (L Series). Allow it 5 minutes for it to show up in the schedule.     FAQ and troubleshooting The integration seems to be enabled but no revenue is coming in If configured correctly, the revenue will be visible at the bottom of the schedule. Make sure that ‚ÄúRevenue‚Äù is enabled under  Planday  >  Schedule  >  View . Make sure there are existing shifts on the week or the day you ÃÅre looking at, otherwise the revenue might not show. Allow 5 minutes for the revenue to update if you make any changes to the schedule. Are you looking at the correct department/location? In the top left corner of Planday you can switch between departments/locations: Revenue is coming in, but the numbers are incorrect Review the steps under ‚ÄúIntegration settings‚Äù *If you make any changes, allow 5 minutes for the integration to update.   Can I connect several Lightspeed accounts to the same Planday organisation? Yes, it's possible. To add another Lightspeed account to your Planday,  go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  find the relevant Lightspeed integration tile and click on  Connect click on  Connect account  and add the details of that second connection Then, you can link the relevant revenue units ( corresponding to the departments) to the relevant Lightspeed floors.

To send leave data over to your payroll system, there will need to be data on the schedule. This will mean creating a shift, marked with an absence  Shift type , so it will be sent over to your payroll system.   Here are some steps to follow to make sure leave data is being sent over. Creating your absence accounts Go to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  (or  Absence, Overtime, Vacation ) >  Account templates  and create your absence accounts as normal. You can use both fixed and accrued accounts, for your salaried and hourly employees. These will still form the basics of your absence system, allowing you to book holidays and keep track of both absence and accrued accounts for your employees.   For more information on this step, check out this guide on  creating absence accounts .   Create a Shift type Go to  Settings > Schedule > Shift types , and create a  Shift type  to use when creating absence shifts on the schedule. Give it a name and set the rate to 100%. The salary code is important, as this is what will connect this Shift type to your payroll system: If using a Sage50 integration, the  Salary code  for this Shift type must match the Sage payroll element you use for absence. For this example, let's say that the element and the leave type are both set to the salary code 2. Your Shift type should then look like this:   And the following functions should read as:   Once the Shift type is created, you are ready to apply it to shifts on the Schedule, which will be how we send the holiday hours and payment to your payroll system.   Requesting Absence You will use Planday to keep track of your absence balances and your absence requests. All absences will come through Planday first, and then on to the payroll system.   The process for both requesting and approving absence will be the same as normal, for both fixed and accrued absence accounts. Absence will be requested by the employee and approved by the manager through  Schedule > Leave requests .   For more information on the absence requests and approvals, have a look at this  guide . Sending Absence data to your payroll system As the absence request on its own has no links to Payroll, you will need to make that connection through Shifts from your Schedule. That way, the correct payment will register automatically.  Go to the  Schedule > Employee view  and find the  Absence . Remember that you can use  Filters  to see only the employees you need. The view should look like this: For each day of the Absence period (marked in the Schedule), you will need to create a Shift that uses the Shift type you created before. The Shift will need to have a Start and End time that correspond to the number of hours deducted from the absence account balance for that day. In the example with the 40 hours/week employee, each Shift would be 8 hours long.   When you've finished creating Shifts (of the Absence Shift type), your Schedule should look like this: As you can see on the left-hand side, underneath the employee's name, they now have 40 hours of Absence time registered for this week, which will automatically be reported to Payroll.

Why integrate Planday with Tenzo? Tenzo is a restaurant analytics platform that enables you to centralise all your operational restaurant data in one place so you can access it on your mobile. You can read more about Tenzo‚Äôs functionalities  here .   Integrating Planday with Tenzo lets you pull through your planned and actual labour hours and costs to use Tenzo‚Äôs advanced reporting to track and visualise the labour KPIs most important for your business.   For example: Analysing your ‚ÄòCost of labour as a Percentage of Sales‚Äô (COL%S) for different hours of the day on the go on your mobile: Reviewing your four-week average COL% alongside revenue for each day of the week on the web: Receiving a daily email to track your COL%S run rate for the week alongside your estimated revenue: How do you integrate Planday with Tenzo? You will need to provide Tenzo with Admin-level access in Planday for the team to set-up the connection.  Before you do this you should check your Planday Configurations.   How do you set up Configurations in Planday Adding hourly wages and monthly salaries to the employee profiles.  Follow these instructions  and make sure to use only one of the options, unless your employee has both a fixed salary and an hourly wage. Review your Shift Types to confirm how each should be handled.  Follow these instructions  to make sure you have all options and rate adjustments that you need. Add potential payroll supplements, such as overtime or evening supplements.  Follow these instructions Verify that the labour costs are correctly added. Once wages, salaries and supplements are set up in Planday, we recommend that you go to  Planday > Payroll > Payroll Export  to verify that the changes are accurate. Generate a PDF payroll export and scroll through your employees to see that they have the correct associated labour cost. If you notice that one or multiple employees are missing their hourly wage or salary, it is most likely because this was inserted incorrectly on the employee‚Äôs profile. Try to insert it again and make sure that the ‚Äúvalid from date‚Äù is set prior to the first day of your current payroll period.   How do you give Tenzo access to Planday? Speak with your Tenzo Customer Success Manager to confirm the email address for the new account. Once this has been confirmed all you‚Äôll need to do is add the email address as a new user with Admin level access. How does Tenzo connect with Planday to access your data? We‚Äôre working on creating a two-way API connection but for the time being, Tenzo receives file transfers by secure FTP with all the details needed which they process behind the scenes.  The Tenzo team will: Set-up a scheduled job in Planday to upload a file of Timesheets information.This file upload will happen on a defined time every day and Tenzo will automatically import the numbers from this source. When this is first set-up the team will go back and upload your historical data as well. What configurations does Tenzo need? The Tenzo team will confirm with you how your Planday Schedules map to the locations you have set up in Tenzo to ensure that your costs are allocated correctly to locations. They will also review the shift-type mappings you have set-up in Planday to set these up the same in Tenzo.   They will also review the Schedule positions you have set-up in Planday to match the Roles you have in Tenzo. If you are using Tenzo forecasting you will also be asked for each location to provide labour rules. These convert your sales forecasts into labour hours: Minimum number of workers at any time (eg. 2 people regardless of sales) Number of workers to open the store with (eg. 1 to prepare the store) Time those workers should start before you officially open the doors (60mins before you open) Number of workers to close the store with (eg. 3 to close the store) Time those workers should finish after you officially close the doors (30mins after you close) Number of employees you need per ¬£ of sales (multiplier - eg 1 person per ¬£100/hour) - Threshold over which the multiplier kicks in (eg. ¬£100/hour) Any additional employees you need during the day How can I configure what labour reporting I see on my Tenzo Dashboard and in my daily reports?

With Planday, you can connect your Lightspeed Retail (X-Series - formerly Vend) POS system and automatically import sales data. This lets you compare your revenue vs payroll costs and helps you plan your schedules to align with the budget. You can connect different X-Series Outlets or individual Registers in those Outlets into Planday Revenue units. Follow this setup guide to configure the integration.   Requirements for the integration For this integration to work, you must complete two prerequisites in Planday. 1. Set up Revenue units in Planday To get this integration working, you must map Planday‚Äôs Revenue units with Lightspeed‚Äôs Registers/Outlets to fetch revenue data. Before setting up the integration, create at least one  Revenue unit  in every Department where you wish to import revenue.  To set up a Revenue unit in Planday, go to  Settings  > under the  Reports  heading, press  Revenue  >  Create. When setting up a Revenue unit, select the option to  Enter daily revenue  for every unit you want to map, along with selecting  Include in total revenue,  as shown in the screenshot below.   üí° For detailed steps, read the  Revenue in Planday  article. 2. Create Shifts on business days where revenue should be imported Revenue can only be imported into business days of your schedule. To create a business day in your schedule, ensure that there is at least one Shift for the given day where you wish to import revenue.  Set up the integration in Planday Follow these steps to find, connect and configure the integration.  Find and connect the integration Once the prerequisites have been completed, go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview.  Switch to the  Point of Sale  tab to see all available POS integrations or search for the integration name from the search bar.   Click  Connect  on the  Lightspeed Retail (X-Series)  tile to open the integration editor. During this step, the integration gains access to Planday data. Connect Lightspeed account Connect one or more Lightspeed POS (X-Series)  Accounts  in the first card in the integration editor by pressing the  Connect account  button.   This will open a log-in screen in a new pop-up window. You must enter your Store URL here, followed by your Vend email and password. ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your browser is not blocking pop-up windows, in which case the log-in window will not open. After signing in, check the Accounts section of the integration, which shows your newly connected account. The green  status  icon üü¢ will inform you that the connection is set up correctly. üí° In case of issues with the connection, a dedicated status message and light will be displayed in front of the account. You can click on the status to read more or take further action if required.   Data import settings When at least one account is connected successfully, you can complete the integration setup by specifying other settings and mappings.  Start import at  -  Choose an hour of the day.  The integration imports revenue data daily at the hour specified in this field. The imports will take place within the set hour, typically close to the start of the hour.  Get data from the past  -  Choose the number of days.  This field allows you to specify how many days of previous data should be imported. The minimum number of days is 1, meaning the integration only imports data from the previous day.  üí°  When selecting more than one day, previously imported revenue on mapped Revenue units is overwritten during every import. The imported values may change over the first several days as payments get processed on Lightspeed‚Äôs side.  Include tax values  -  Choose Yes or No.  By default, the checkbox to include tax values is selected, but you can deselect it - leading to the import of Net sales data.   Link Planday Revenue units with Lightspeed POS Registers or Outlets üí°  At least  one Revenue unit in Planday  is required for this step. Click one of the account names under Registers to open the link window. The linking page shows existing Planday Revenue units and allows you to link any Lightspeed POS (X-Series) Register. It is possible to map multiple Registers in the same Outlet to one Revenue unit and vice versa.   Click  Save  to confirm the mappings. Alternatively, close the window or click the Back button to discard the links. Revenue import details Integration timing The integration imports revenue data from Lightspeed once a day. The import takes place within one hour starting at the selected hour in the  Start import at  field.  Typically, the import runs near the beginning of the specified interval.  Include or exclude tax values Integration by default imports Gross values from mapped locations. To import Net values, uncheck the ‚Äú Include tax values ‚Äù option. Revenue value The imported revenue is the sum of revenue values of all active Registers mapped to the Revenue unit from successfully connected Lightspeed accounts. If any Lightspeed account connection does not work, revenue from the Account‚Äôs registers will not count in the revenue imported into the mapped Revenue units. ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that incomplete revenue values will overwrite correct values imported in the past if a Lightspeed account connection stops working and if you are importing values for several days in the past. FAQs and troubleshooting How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, you can remove individual connected Lightspeed accounts. This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be overwritten.  üí° Alternatively, click the  Options  drop-down on the Lightspeed Retail X-Series tile on the Integrations Overview page, then click  Revoke authorisation . This will revoke the integration‚Äôs access to Planday and stop all scheduled import jobs.     How can I verify imported values? To verify in Planday:  Open the  Schedule  page on Planday. Press the  View settings  button, and  turn on  the  Revenue  toggle to reveal earnings values at the bottom of each business day. Revenue imported for a given Revenue unit is displayed in the  Daily revenue  pop-up. üí° Note that the Notes field contains the timestamp of the revenue import and a label of the revenue source. The shown timestamp reflects the  UCT time zone  and is not adjusted for your Planday organisation‚Äôs location! To Verify in Lightspeed:  The data in X-Series can be checked under your Lightspeed dashboard. Browse   your store account in Lightspeed and navigate  Menu  >  Sell  >  Sales History . Nothing happens when I click Connect account Ensure your browser is not blocking pop-up windows, which can often lead to the log-in window not appearing.   Revenue not importing Ensure that there is at least one Shift on the Schedule for each day where revenue should be imported. Ensure that the  Enter daily revenue  checkbox, located in  Settings  >  Revenue , is selected for mapped revenue units. Verify that Lightspeed Retail X-Series registers are mapped to Revenue units of relevant Departments.   The account needs to be reconnected In some instances, authorisation to the connected account can fail, and the account will need to be reconnected. You can see the current status of the connected accounts displayed next to the corresponding account when you open the integration tile. To reconnect the account, you must click on the account‚Äôs table row in the Accounts section. A pop-up window asking you to sign in again will appear. You must log in to the correct X-series account. Once you sign in, the connection status will be updated in the table. ‚ö†Ô∏è When an account needs to be reconnected, its revenue will not be imported into Planday, meaning that you might notice unusually low revenue shown in the Schedule. To remedy this, after reconnecting the account, you can increase the number of imported days to overwrite days showing partial revenue figures.   Revenue imported to Planday does not match the value reported by Vend A. Vend ‚Äì Rounding issue Sometimes, the sale total will have some rounding calculation (more or less ~GBP0.01) due to tax calculations not falling on an exact penny value. When these fractional pennies accumulate over many sales, the differences can be seen more evidently.  This issue occurs only when tax is included in the import. B. Check Payments Status  The integration calculates revenue based on sales marked as: Completed On Account Delivery, completed Layby, completed On account, completed Pickup, completed Pickup, unfulfilled Delivery, unfulfilled Since payments can take up to a few days to be processed, it is possible that imported revenue will not correspond to values shown in X-Series or that the value shown in the Schedule will change on the next import.  C. Check Connection Status  Please check once all connections are in  Connected  status. If some connection doesn‚Äôt work properly, sales related to Registers from this connection will not be imported.   Can I connect several Lightspeed accounts to the same Planday organisation? Yes, it's possible. To add another Lightspeed account to your Planday,  go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  find the relevant Lightspeed integration tile and click on  Connect click on  Connect account  and add the details of that second connection Then, you can link the relevant revenue units ( corresponding to the departments) to the relevant Lightspeed Registers.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate Fortnox with Planday. Looking for the Fortnox setup guide? See  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 1 . FAQs What data will be synced during payroll sync? Hours, supplements, meal deductions, and meal contributions with supported cause codes and salary codes will be transferred to Fortnox only for the employees included in the mapping between Planday & Fortnox.    Pay rates or monthly salaries will not be synced to Fortnox, but depending on your integration settings, Planday can fetch pay rates and salaries of mapped employees from Fortnox to Planday daily at 03:00 am. üí°Please keep in mind that there might be differences between pay rates in Planday Preview and the rates in Fortnox. Can the old file export still be used? The file export can still be used for other Swedish payroll systems, but we recommend using the dedicated  integration for Fortnox  sync since it supports the functionality of the file export and much more. Does the payroll sync include the worked hours of salaried employees? Yes, but this needs to be set up per employee in Planday. Read more in the  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 2  article. What kind of allocation method is used when monthly salaries are synced from Fortnox? Scheduled hours. Will newly created employees in Fortnox automatically be added to Planday? No, employee accounts will not be automatically created in Planday. If you wish to push Fortnox employee data to Planday, you can navigate to the Fortnox integration and choose which employees you'd like to import from Fortnox. Read more in the  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 1  article. Will newly created employees in Planday automatically be added to Fortnox? This is not done automatically, but when creating new employees in Planday, admins can select  Create new user in Fortnox  to send the newly created employee over. How can I add new employees to an existing employee data mapping? When Fortnox is active and running, you can add the employee directly to Fortnox and save them to the existing mapping while creating their account. For your new hires, you'd go to  People  >  Employees  >  Create employee  and fill in their details as you normally would. You will also find a Fortnox section where you can press  Add  to add the employee mapping. Here, you can choose whether to add them to an existing employee entry from the  Fortnox user  dropdown or decide to create a new employee automatically, which also means that you will  not  need to add them in Fortnox manually. üí° If you have more than one  Fortnox account  connected, you can choose which account the new employee should be added to. Please keep in mind that if you choose to  Create a new user in Fortnox , you will need to make sure that none of the required fields in Fortnox is left empty, in addition to any required fields you might have set in Planday.   At this step, the required information for the employee entry in Fortnox will also be required in Planday, and if anything is missing, it will be highlighted as required when you try to Save.   Once everything is in place, you'll see a confirmation message when you save your employee's data.   To verify, if you click on quick-edit for the newly created employee entry, you will see a confirmation that the employee data is being successfully synced to Fortnox.   However, if the sync fails, a red error message will be shown, explaining what went wrong or how to fix it. How can I verify whether an employee's data is mapped? To check that an existing employee in Planday is mapped in Fortnox, go to  People  >  Employees , find the employee and open the  quick edit view  (‚úèÔ∏è icon).   The employee profile will have a  Fortnox  section, where you can see a label showing the name of the connected Fortnox account. If the data is mapped and synced correctly, a confirmation message will be shown in green.   How can I remove an employee from an existing employee data mapping? Navigate to  People  >  Employees  > select the employee you need to remove and click on the quick edit icon ( ‚úèÔ∏è ). In the  Fortnox  section, click the X icon next to the Fortnox account label to remove the mapping and click  Save  to confirm. Can I include Cost centres (Resultatenheter/Kostnadsst√§llen)? Yes, you can sync data with Cost centre allocation by enabling that functionality in the integration editor and adding your Fortnox Cost centre codes into Department numbers in Planday. Are vacation days/hours from the Absence accounts in Planday supported? No, please use  Shift types  with the Cause code / Salary code ‚Äú SEM ‚Äù instead. Can I export overtime or flex, or vacation account balances? No. Are manual, weekly, personal or seniority supplements supported? No. What happens if my organisation uses different employee salary identifiers in different departments? The integration recognises only the main ‚ÄúSalary identifier‚Äù field, but it is still possible to use the integration. If salary identifiers do not appear to be correct on your employee mapping, you might need to make edits in the Employee form and payroll preview. Does the integration respect the payroll setting: ‚Äúexclude zero-hours from export‚Äù and ‚Äúexclude salary codes‚Äù? Yes. What happens if I have clicked Sync several times for the same pay run period? All the previous data for the same employees for the same salary codes/cause codes and date ranges will be cleared in Fortnox, before new data will be transferred. Which fields are required when I want my Planday employee to be created in Fortnox automatically? Personal Identity Number (PD SSN/Tax ID) Employee Id (PD salary identifier) First name Last name Address1 Post Code City Which fields are required when I want my Fortnox employee entry to automatically be created as a new user in Planday? In Planday, the following fields are always required to create an employee. First Name Last Name Email (used as username in Planday)  In addition, there may be customised settings for your organisation that you may want to keep in sync. You can see or update your  Employee form  settings by visiting  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup. ‚ö†Ô∏è  We recommend not to rename system fields in the form to avoid confusion. If you wish to import employees from Fortnox, you must not mark any additional fields as required, as the integration cannot populate custom fields, and the import will fail. What are Cause codes? Cause codes are the equivalent of a Swedish term,  Registreringskoder,  which defines groupings of salary codes that can be found in Fortnox. These Cause codes determine whether the shift/hours represent working time, different types of absence, or supplements.    The data synchronised is grouped by Employee and per Cause code for all pay types, except meal contributions and meal deductions which use  Salary codes  instead.   Using Cause codes can save you a lot of time and tedious work. For example, you do not have to record personal leave and sickness as two different Shift types (with different Salary codes), but instead with one Shift type with one Cause code. Based on the Cause code, Fortnox will use its built-in logic to determine which Salary codes to assign to different hours for sick pay or vacation pay based on the employees‚Äô settings in Fortnox and their current balances. What is a Salary code? Salary codes  in Planday are similar to what Cause codes are in Fortnox. Essentially Salary codes in Planday are used to identify specific types of shifts to match with their corresponding Cause code values in Fortnox. The rate per hour on the monthly salary of an employee shows up as ‚Äúinfinity‚Äù. Why? This means that the employee data has no value for ‚ÄúContracted hours‚Äù in Planday, prior to the first monthly salary being added by the integration. In these cases, the  Contracted hours  field is empty, and the system cannot calculate the correct hourly rate. You can fix this by editing the monthly salary and entering a number into the ‚ÄúContracted hours‚Äù field. I encounter errors when I try to Sync my payroll data to Fortnox. What can I do? The  Sync status  will show how many employees could not have the payroll data successfully exported. It will also list any employees whose payroll data could not be synced. (as shown in the screenshot below). By clicking on each employee‚Äôs name or the row, you'll see more details about the specific pay items that failed to sync, including: the  date  for the pay item the  type :  Worked hours (regular hours and supplements) Absence (hours from shift types that are categorised as absence) Meal contribution or meal deduction The type can indicate which Shift caused the error. If the error is not immediately apparent, review the checklist described in this  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 2  article or contact our support team for assistance.   I get a *Salary code not matching the Cost code error* when I try to sync my payroll data to Fortnox. What can I do? This could be because one of the cost code values is not in use or misspelt. Please ensure you use the correct cost codes when entering them in the salary code fields in Planday. See the supported Cost codes values here. What Cause codes are supported? When editing Shift types or supplements in Planday, you can use the corresponding supported Cause codes to identify them in Fortnox. Code Description Common Planday usage Type ARB Timl√∂n / Hourly pay Shift data (Shift type: normal) for hourly-paid employees Worked Hours TID Arbetstid / Worked hours Shift data (Shift type: normal) of monthly paid employees Most customers use the setting to exclude this from export.

Written by  Sepideh   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins. Looking for  All Gravy setup guide? Setup Q: What if I have more than one Planday account? A: If you have more than one Planday account (for instance, different restaurants, locations, etc.) you will need to create a new All Gravy account for each of the Planday accounts.   Further, you will need to connect each All Gravy account with Planday. Q: What is a Child Account? A: Some restaurants have a setup where they have multiple Planday accounts linked to one - in these cases you create 1 All Gravy account for each child account. Q: I just connected with Planday, but I can't my employees in the list yet? A: After connecting with Planday, it can take up to 2 minutes for it to import the employees. If you refresh your browser after 2 minutes, you should see the imported employees. Q: I can‚Äôt see my new employee(s) in All Gravy? A: All Gravy and Planday automatically update every hour on the hour, so should be available within 60 minutes. Q: When I‚Äôm setting up, I have to choose between ‚ÄúAll completed shifts‚Äù vs ‚ÄúAllow confirmed shifts‚Äù - what does that mean? A: This decides whether employees should be able to withdraw money as soon as a shift is completed, or first when it has been approved by a manager in Planday. Some companies approve shifts almost immediately after a shift has ended - in these cases, it makes sense to choose ‚ÄòAllow confirmed shifts‚Äô. ‚ÄúAll completed shifts‚Äù means that your employees can withdraw their salary as soon as the shift is completed in Planday - use this if you approve shifting frequently (more than 2 hours after the shift is done). Q: Which integrations do I need to get All Gravy to work? A: We have created all Gravy with the vision of an easy plug-and-play setup- so all you need is Planday and your payroll provider. We support almost everyone, including Zenegy, DataL√∏n, Danl√∏n, etc. Q: How long does it take to set All Gravy up? A: Integrating with Planday takes less than 10 minutes.   Admin work  Q: Does it take extra time to do salary when we have All Gravy? A: It should add about 5 minutes to your monthly payroll process. Q: Does All Gravy work with my payroll system? A: We currently support Zenegy, Danl√∏n, Datal√∏n, Intect.io, ProL√∏n, Lessor, and others. Contact us if you‚Äôre in doubt.   How does it work? Q: Is All Gravy a payroll provider? A: No, All Gravydoes not replace your payroll provider- we simply integrate between Planday and your payroll provider. Q: How does All Gravy know what the right tax is for my employees? A: Depending on your payroll provider, we either get the correct tax information directly from them or the employees themselves enter this into the app when onboarding - we have of course included a guide for them on how to find this. Q : How do we avoid double paying my employees? A: By integrating with your payroll system, we simply make sure that All Gravyon a monthly basis shares the withdrawals made in that payroll period with your payroll system. Q: What will it look like on my employee's salary slip? A: It will be registered as an ‚Äúaconto-udbetaling‚Äù (advancepayment) and will show on the salary slip as ‚ÄúAll Gravy Withdrawal‚Äù. Q: What does All Gravy do to our liquidity? Will it affect our liquidity? A: All Gravy provides the company with two possibilities: All Gravy provides liquidity:  We pay out the employees withdrawals from our bank account and invoice you monthly. You provide liquidity:  The customer pays a deposit, in which case we will take the employee‚Äôs withdrawals from that account and get the deposit refilled on a monthly basis.   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate Fortnox with Planday. Are you looking for the Fortnox FAQ? See  Fortnox integration - FAQ and troubleshooting . Connect Planday with Fortnox to keep your information up to date in both systems and make managing data more manageable and time-efficient. You can manage and sync data with just a few clicks when the integration runs.   This guide will walk you through the steps needed to configure the connection between Planday and Fortnox, including connecting to a Fortnox account and mapping employee data across the systems. Connect your Fortnox account This will open a new view where you need to configure the integration. Activate the integration by pressing the toggle. In the Accounts section, press  Add , which will redirect you to Fortnox's login page, where you need to log in to your Fortnox account.   After logging in, you can review the requested permissions and authorise the connection to Planday. üí° You must have  sysadmin  rights in Fortnox to authorise the application. If you do not already have one, you must obtain a Fortnox integration license. (More information on the Fortnox pricing  page ). When the authorisation is successful, you'll be redirected back to Planday on the integration settings page. Open the Fortnox integration again by pressing  Manage . You should now see the account name you just connected listed in the  Accounts  section. With at least one Fortnox account connected, you can go on to match the employee data between Planday and Fortnox.   Create an employee data mapping For the integration to work as intended, you need to set up an employee mapping to ensure that the employee information in Planday matches their corresponding employee data entries in Fortnox. This is required to enable integration and guarantee that the data will be synced correctly between the two systems.   From the Fortnox integration settings page, in the  Employee data  section, press  Create mapping .   Next, select one of your connected  Fortnox accounts . If you have any employee records in Fortnox that do not yet exist in Planday, those can be created automatically. That is why the next step is to select a Department in Planday for the new employee data.  üí°  You can change an Employee's department later by going to  People  >  Employees  and clicking their name to edit their information. Verify employee data mapping Once the data is loaded, it will be displayed for you to verify and confirm or fix any inconsistencies before the mapping is created.   This list should contain the employee entries from Planday (with their salary identifier), their counterpart entry from Fortnox (with their employee ID), and the sync status between the two systems.   Matching existing employees Suggested matches: The automatically matched suggestions are marked by a blue link icon. Based on the employee's username (email address) in Planday and their email address in Fortnox. It can also be based on their ID when the Planday salary identifier matches their employee ID in Fortnox. Manual matches: Also marked by a blue link icon. For employees with data in both systems but for which the email or the salary identifier does not match, you can create a link from the  Add employees  button. Once added to the mapping their profiles match accordingly in the list, the blue link icon should show, confirming their status.  After you click  Add employees , you can switch between two lists of employee data entries, from Planday and Fortnox.  After selecting which employees to add to the mapping from the lists, click  Save . If no employees on the list need to be added or you don't have changes to make, click  Cancel  to return to the previous view. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è A red warning icon next to an employee entry means that information is missing from some fields. Please keep in mind to check that the Planday required fields for employee data are not empty when creating a mapping between Fortnox and Planday. You can check and configure the required property for the data field in  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup .   Importing employees Marked by a  green  icon.  If data for an employee only exists only in Planday or only in Fortnox, you'll also need to add them manually. Click the  + Add employees  button, select the employees available from either list and then press  Save . This will create a new employee entry in Planday or Fortnox.  Please note that different data fields may be required in each system, and those cannot be empty. If a required field is empty, a red warning icon will appear next to that employee‚Äôs name. This means that you will not only be able to create a new employee entry before all the required fields have relevant data. However, you would be able to map that employee to an already existing entry. You can read more about it in the  Fortnox FAQ article . üí° At any point during the process, you can check out the  Summary  box on the right-hand side. This shows the number of employees grouped by status and reflects what will happen when the integration is saved. If you hover over the info icon in the Summary box, you'll get a list of what information with be synced from Planday to Fortnox when updated in Planday. Once you match employee records from the two systems, you're ready to add the mapping to your integration. Press  Add to integration  button in the top right corner.   Editing or deleting employee mappings You can always change the mapping you created between the two systems by going to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview ,   finding the Fortnox Integration, and then clicking  Manage.   Under  Employee data , you'll find the existing mappings. Click anywhere on the row or hover over the row and select the  Edit  ( ‚úèÔ∏è ) icon.   Here, you can select a new default Department (within Planday) or continue to edit the existing mapping by clicking  Sync .  Similar to creating an employee mapping, you can fine-tune the individual employee mappings. You might notice a grey icon in the Status column when editing an employee data mapping. This indicates that the mapping for that employee has already been created. Additionally, some employees may have a  yellow  icon as their Status, representing that their profile has been deactivated in Planday. If you want to exclude employees from your existing mapping, you can remove them one by one from the  X  icon on their row. Once you're done with the necessary changes, click  Save .   If you want to  delete an employee mapping entirely  (or remove the mapping for all the mapped employees at once), click the Delete ( üóë ) icon by hovering over the name of the mapping.   Additional Employee data settings You'll notice two options turned on by default in the  Employee data  section. Here is what they do: Keep Fortnox up to date with employee data from Planday -  Synchronise the changes to employee data fields from Planday to Fortnox. (Changes are synced instantly to Fortnox.) Keep Planday up to date with the latest pay rates and monthly salaries from Fortnox -  Synchronize the hourly rates and fixed monthly salary rates from Fortnox to Planday  (daily sync at 03:00 am). Here, you can also see a quick overview of your existing mapping. This includes the Planday Department where the newly added employees will be created (if any) and a reference for how many employees have their data included in the mapping. When you've mapped employees and adjusted sync settings, you can move to the next step and set up payroll.   Next: Manage and sync payroll data to Fortnox   Need more help?

If you‚Äôre using Lohn AG to manage your company payroll, quickly export your payroll data from Planday into a payroll report based on the worktime import to Lohn AG. Follow the steps below to get the most out of using Lohn AG and Planday.   1. Activate payroll export for Lohn AG Log into Planday and go to the integration page in  Settings > Integrations > All . Find  Lohn AG,  click  Add,  and press  Activate.   2. Add salary identifiers & codes to Planday To ensure you have the correct payroll format to match your records in both systems, you need to add your salary identifiers and salary codes from Lohn AG to Planday.

Salary codes Update Planday with Salary codes from Lohn AG so it can identify if the data in the export file should be counted as normal hours, special hours or payroll supplements.    If you want to apply salary codes for Payroll supplements, you need to create the payroll supplements and then add the salary code according to the specifications from Lohn AG, which you can also see below. Create the payroll supplements in  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplements.   If you are using Planday to register e.g. sickness and it's created as a shift type, you can also apply salary codes to that specific  Shift types.  Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types  and  edit  the shift type you want to apply the salary code for.   Lohn AG is working with specific salary codes for the shift types, which you can see here:   Finally, if you want to separate the hours between different employee groups for the employees payroll, you can apply specific salary codes to different employee groups. Apply salary codes to employee groups in the top menu  People  >  Employee groups  > and edit the employee group to enter the salary code. The salary code for the employee group will then overwrite the salary code for normal worked hours. Learn more about  Preparing for payroll .   Before exporting the payroll export file, remember to check up on approved shifts.   3. Export Lohn AG payroll reports from Planday Go to  Payroll > Payroll export . Choose date interval.

To apply salary codes for payroll supplements, create the payroll supplements and then add the salary code.  Create the payroll supplements under  Settings > Payroll > Payroll supplements . When creating or editing the supplements you will be given the option to enter the specific salary code. If you are using Planday to register alternate shift types such as sickness, you can also apply salary codes to that specific shift type. Go to  Settings > Schedule > Shift types  and edit the shift type you want to apply the salary code to. Finally, if you want to separate the hours between different employee groups for the employee‚Äôs payroll, you can apply specific salary codes to different employee groups. Go to  People > Employee groups , select the Edit button and enter the salary code for the group. The salary code for the Employee group will then overwrite the salary code for normal worked hours.

In the File Format field choose  Datev LODAS . Press  Prepare report. Save the file on your desktop. You are now ready to import your file into Datev LODAS. Add cost centre and cost units If you are using Cost Centre and Cost Units in Datev Lodas, you should know that the payroll file can export payroll data, in a single file in Datev Loda, for all Cost Centers and Units. Simply, make sure that  Departments  (from Planday) are set up as Cost Centers and that the elements using  Salary Code 2  are set up as Cost Units. If you'd like to use this feature but don't have support for  Salary Code 2  enabled, please contact our support team   for assistance.  From the Integration's settings, you can select to  Include Cost Centre and Cost Units . Generating a report from  Payroll  >  Export payroll  will then include the information selected.

If you are outside your workplace or at the wrong location, go back and try again. Ensure that you're connected to the correct company Wi-Fi Your employer can optionally restrict the use of the Punch Clock to an approved Wi-Fi network of their choice. In this case, you can clock in  only if your device is on an approved Wi-Fi network , and not from another network or mobile data. If necessary, open your Wi-Fi settings to check that you are connected to a company Wi-Fi with good signal strength.    Turn on Wi-Fi, Location services, and Mobile Data As outlined in the previous steps, Punch Clock may be restricted by location or Wi-Fi network. A good signal strength when using mobile data is usually sufficient if there are no restrictions. You can ensure that Wi-Fi and mobile data are activated in your mobile device settings.

Feel free to contact your manager directly to learn more about how Punch Clock is set up at your facility. If using an Android device, ensure location services are enabled by swiping down from the top or navigating to Location from the Settings panel. Turn on the feature there and set options to improve accuracy if necessary. The steps may vary slightly depending on the Android device. If you have any questions or problems, please get in touch with Android support. If you've followed the steps above and still have trouble with location services, you can check the maps app to see if your position is accurate enough. If you have problems, talk to your manager to check whether the punch radius is too small for the Punch Clock to be functional. Restart the Planday app and your smartphone In some cases, fully closing the Planday application and restarting it can resolve Punch Clock issues. You can also try restarting your mobile device.   Uninstall and reinstall the Planday app If you experience repeated problems using the app, it may help to uninstall completely and  reinstall it again .   Make sure the time is set correctly on the device The device used for clocking in and clocking out should be set to the correct time. This applies to both a shared device (a tablet, computer or laptop) and employees' personal devices. If possible, allow your device to automatically set the date and time for maximum accuracy.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ This article is for employees using the Planday app or the web to request time off. Are you an Admin looking to  register leave on behalf of an employee ?  In Planday, leave from work requests are supported if your manager or admin has set up an absence account for you. Different leave rules for requesting leave from work will apply depending on your company and country. Planday makes it easy to see available balances and request time off from the app. üí° Requesting leave is not the same as reporting Unavailable. If you want to signal to your manager that you prefer to be assigned to shifts on certain days or not, the  Set availability  function can be helpful to indicate your wishes. How to request leave from the Planday app üí° The following process is valid for both Android and iOS devices. Slight differences in the UI are described in the article.   To make a leave request from the Planday app, press  More , then  Time off  for an overview of your Absence account balance. Press  Request  (or  +  on Android) at the top right to create a new leave request.    If you have multiple leave accounts, you can choose which account you want to use for this request.   Press the first and last date of your leave period and press  Next  (or  ‚úî  on Android) in the top right corner to go to the next step. Once the period is selected, you can see an overview of your request, add a comment if you want, and see the cost of each day in your request. Press  Send  (or  ‚úî  on Android) from the top right corner to submit your request.    Your recently sent request will appear under  Pending requests  until a manager takes action to approve or deny the request.   Your manager will receive your request to be off and can approve or reject the request. You can always check your existing requests on the  Time off  screen or cancel a pending request if you feel you no longer need the off.   How to request leave from Planday web You can also request leave by logging into Planday on the web and going to  Home  >  Your leave overview  >  Accounts.    Press  Request leave  and follow the two-step process to request a leave. You can request half-day leave by inputting  0.5  as the day's value. (Option to request half-day leave is available only via the web platform and not the app)   To see the status of your past or current leave requests, switch to the  Requests  tab from  Home  >  Your leave overview  >  Accounts  page.   FAQs and troubleshooting I am unable to apply for leave Possible reasons: Make sure you have an active absence account assigned. Without it, you won't be able to request leave. If unsure, contact your manager. Check if there's another request overlapping in time. Pay attention to the validity period of your absence account. Requests outside this period won't succeed. Avoid entering ""0"" (zero) days in the absence request. To remove a leave day within a period, submit two separate leave requests. Need more help?

Use this article to find your way around the various features of Planday mobile app.   Download the Planday app If you have not done already,  download the Planday app  for free from your device's App Store by searching for  Planday Employee Scheduling . The app works on  iPhones  and  Android  devices.   You will need a  Planday URL  from your manager to log in. Your  username will be your email address,  and your  password  can be set up by  clicking the invite  sent by your manager to your email. Overview After logging in, you will see an overview screen with information that matters to you the most. You will use this screen to  punch in  when you arrive at work and  punch out  when you finish your shift.   The overview screen also has a link to  your profile ,  assigned shifts , available  open shifts , company  news , or any upcoming  events. üí° You can update your preferences for language, notifications, or personal details by tapping your Profile icon in the top right. Set your profile & language settings Tap on your profile icon from the Overview screen to enter your Profile section. Here you can: Set a new  profile picture . Change your Planday account's  language . Disable  notifications  from the app. Sync your shifts to an  external calendar . Switch between your Planday accounts  if you use Planday with multiple employers. Learn more in the  Adding and modifying your personal information in Planday   article.     Use Punch Clock for accurate time tracking If your company is using the Punch Clock tool, you can  punch in and out  at the beginning and end of your shift, as well as during breaks (if this function has been activated by your Planday admin). This will track your actual working time down to the minute.   When you punch in or out, it's helpful to add a comment if you were late or worked overtime. This allows your manager to review and approve your hours with the correct information, ensuring accuracy in your payment.   See all your upcoming shifts Under Y our shifts  section, you can easily view a brief summary of your upcoming assigned shifts. Simply tap on a shift to find out details such as your colleagues for the day, your work location, and any important notes from your manager. If your Planday admin has enabled it, you may also have the option to  swap ,  handover , or  sell  your shift to your colleagues.     Swapping and handing over shifts with colleagues To manage your shifts with colleagues, simply select a future shift and choose to swap it with a colleague's or hand it over to someone else. In the  More  >  Requests  section, you can easily see all the  swaps and pending action requests  from your colleagues. From here, you have the option to accept or decline the exchange, as well as check the status of your own requests.   üí°  It's important to note that shift swaps usually require approval from your manager before they become final.   Apply for open shifts Open shifts are available shifts that are up for grabs. These can also include shifts put on sale by your colleagues. You can ask to take these  open and available shifts  by pressing  Request shift . Usually, a manager has to approve your request before the shift can be yours.     Read News & Events The  News area  in the app informs you about news, general information or last-minute changes. Check the news regularly to stay up to date.   The  Events  section is used to organise parties, company outings, courses or other events. Depending on the event, your manager may ask you to confirm or cancel your participation.   Learn more in the  News and Events  article.        Communicate with your colleagues Planday has a  messenger  built into the app, allowing you to communicate with your colleagues without remembering their contact details. You can use this system to send direct messages to your colleagues, communicate with your team or send company-wide messages.   Besides messages from your team, you will also receive Planday alerts here regarding updates to your shifts, changes to the schedule or swap requests.   More   By pressing  More  in the bottom right-hand corner of your screen, you'll find more options in your Planday app. In this section, you can manage your  requests , see your  shifts , your  worked hours , register your  holiday  or  availability  and much more. ‚¨áÔ∏è   See your scheduled hours To view an overview and total of your approved and scheduled hours and shifts, follow these simple steps: Tap on  More  in the Planday app. Select  Your hours . You'll see the information displayed per month, showing a summary of your hours. The start date aligns with your company's pay period set by the administrator.     Set your availability  If your Planday administrator has enabled this tool, you can mark when you are available to work and when you cannot.  Availability  makes it easier for schedule managers to offer you open shifts or see if you are free for work.     View a list of your colleagues If your Planday administrator has enabled access to the People page, you'll find an overview of your colleagues and their contact information. You'll see the list of your colleagues and their contact information only if they have their contact information set to public.   Apply for leave If your Planday admin has enabled this option, you'll be able to request leave directly from the app.  Under  Time off , you can request leave and see an overview of your absence accounts and their balances, as well as your pending and actioned requests.    Find more information in  How to apply for leave or absence .  If you're having issues when you request leave, check with your manager that you have an active absence account. You can send them  this troubleshooting guide  to help them. View your documents and contracts Under  Documents , you'll find the general documents that your employer has uploaded, like for example the employee handbook. You'll also find your payslips, along with your contracts and other signed or unsigned documents.   Find more information in  View payslips, contracts and documents on the Planday app .

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For users of Planday app.  See  instructions to synchronise on Android  or with the  iPhone's calendar app . What is calendar synchronisation via URL Planday offers a default calendar URL for synchronisation with external calendars. The external calendar must support synchronisation via URL to synchronise your schedule. For example, not all Android calendars allow direct synchronisation via calendar URLs. If in doubt, find out in the support area of your provider whether this is possible. How to synchronise your schedule with an external calendar To synchronise your shifts with an external calendar, first log into the Planday app and follow these steps: Tap your profile icon. Copy the calendar URL to the clipboard. Android  - Tap  Copy Link  under the  Sync with Calendar  section. iPhone  - Tap  Sync with calendar  >  Copy calendar link . The URL will then be copied to your clipboard. In the next step, you must paste it into the desired calendar app or the respective destination on the computer.   Example: Synchronisation with Google Calendar First, copy the calendar URL as described in the steps above. Open  Google Calendar  - Go to  Calendar.Google.com  from your web browser. You can bring the URL from the smartphone to the computer. Use a messenger application, email yourself the link, or copy it manually. In Google Calendar, go to  Other Calendars  > Press the plus icon ‚ûï > select  From URL .  Now paste the Planday URL directly into the  From URL  field, and press  Add calendar . Optionally, you can rename this calendar to something appropriate such as  Planday Shifts . üí° Before inserting the calendar URL, ensure that it starts with https:// Otherwise, you will get an error message that the URL is invalid.   With this step complete, your Planday shifts will now be displayed in your Google Calendar. This can be synchronised with other calendar apps on your phone as required.   ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that the synchronisation is not instant. Any new shifts assigned to you may not show right away.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For experienced admins.  Assign a salary to your employees  first. Enable payroll costs in the schedule You can view the payroll hours and costs of your salaried and waged employees in the schedule to help you to plan your shifts effectively.    üí°  You can activate the settings for payroll costs to appear on the schedule by going to  Schedule  >  View settings  > and activating  Payroll hours & costs. If you pay employees a fixed salary instead of wages, you have various options for calculating the salary costs in the schedule. In this article, you will learn about those calculation methods and can decide which method to use.   To assign a fixed salary to an employee, see the article  How to set an employee's fixed salary . Select an employee >  Edit  >  Employment  >  Salary  >  Edit salary . In the top section of the edit window - Payroll information - you should see the data entered for your employee's salary:   If salary data has been added, go to the next section  Payroll costs in Schedule. üí° Remember that the cost allocation and payroll are different. Salary will be reflected in the payroll as a set amount regardless of how you allocate the cost in the schedule. Calculate payroll costs based on Salary amount In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Salary amount .   You can see a direct calculation of this in the lower section, Estimated costs per hour. Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary amount is divided by the number of shift hours in the schedule for the current salary period. When entered in the rota, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works that day. Example: An employee is paid a fixed salary of ¬£2000. The estimated cost per hour - ¬£26.67 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of shift hours in the schedule - in this case, 75. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift in the schedule is given as ¬£160.02 (6*¬£26.67). üí°  The  Payroll start day  is the day of the month from which each salary calculation will begin. This value can't be set as a higher number because the month of February has 28 days (with the exception of leap years). Calculate payroll costs based on Scheduled hours In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Scheduled hours .   You can see a direct calculation in the lower section  Estimated hourly cost . Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary is divided by the expected working hours in the Schedule. When entered in the schedule, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works on that day. The total cost may therefore differ from the fixed salary, depending on how many hours are assigned to the employee. The actual salary cost will not change for Payroll even if the cost on the Schedule is higher/lower.   Example: An employee receives a fixed salary sum of ¬£2.000 and is supposed to work 60 hours per month according to their contract. The estimated cost per hour - ¬£33.33 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the expected hours worked. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift is indicated in the schedule as 200.00¬£ (6 * ¬£33.33). Calculate payroll costs based on Business days In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Bussiness days . For  Business days , select the days of the week to be included in the calculation.  For  Show in Schedule for , select the department in which to display the salary costs. In the lower area,  Estimated daily cost , you can see a direct calculation. Optional: You can change the day of the month from which the salary is calculated at  Show cost calculation each month, starting from . Confirm your selection by pressing  Save . The estimated daily cost is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of opening days in the  Pay period  (by default: Monthly). The estimated daily cost may vary from month to month, depending on the business days in the period.   Don‚Äôt show (default) By default, the option  Don't show  is set. This means that the fixed salary is not taken into account when calculating the total payroll costs on the schedule. However, it remains added for the Payroll export data.   Need more help?

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For advanced admins. Read the  Overview of Payroll supplements  to get acquainted with the Payroll supplements in Planday.   Payroll supplements are an automatic way to add extra payments to shifts or parts of shifts. This can be useful for setting overtime, weekend, or night rates. In this article, you‚Äôll see some examples of commonly used Payroll supplements and how to set them up. Since they are only examples for each type of supplement, you might need to tweak them to fit your needs.    You can create payroll supplements by navigating  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement .    Remember that as soon as you add a Payroll supplement, it might be applied to all the hours in your schedule unless you specify a time range. Make sure to take this into account before you do a pay run. üí° Please note that payroll supplements will be applied backdated (from the beginning of the payroll period). We recommend that you set them up when a new payroll period starts or very soon after. Normal supplement Normal supplements are best used when rates are affected by specific times of the day.      Weekend supplement In this example, you will be looking at using a Normal supplement to add a weekend monetary rate to the system.

If you choose the option ‚ÄúRelative to shift‚Äù in Start type, it will allow you to start the supplement after a certain number of minutes into the shift. For example, by choosing the value ‚Äò240‚Äô, the supplement starts after the employee‚Äôs shift has lasted 240 mins (4 hours). Duration refers to how long the supplement should last in minutes. Payment period : Enter ‚Äô00:00‚Äô in  Start and End time  as you are looking at applying this supplement to any hour worked on the weekend. If you have a specific time period in mind, you could enter this here. Salary code : The salary code can be set to ‚ÄòWeekend supplement‚Äô, so it can be easy to identify on the payroll export.

Week-based supplement Week-based supplements are helpful when you want to create a supplement based on the number of hours someone has worked in a week (e.g. overtime rates).  In this example, employees will be supplemented in a ‚ÄòTime and a Half‚Äô manner, so 150% of their rate, when they work over 40 hours a week.   Supplement type : Choose Week-based supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easy to identify in the future. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Payment period (1) : It can be set to 00:00 ‚Äì 00:00, to include any hours worked on any given day. Payment period (2) : The ‚ÄòFrom‚Äô field related to Hours (in the Payment period) would be 40 in this case, as you want all hours over 40 to have the supplement attached. Then set the ‚ÄòTo‚Äô hours to a maximum ( in this case, 1000), so all hours of the week will be included in the calculation. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Add 50 into the payroll box to to supplement the wage with an extra ‚Äòhalf‚Äô. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Do not enter 150%, as this would actually give employees 250% of their wage, for the applicable hours. Days of the week : Select the days of the week here. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Day-based supplement Day-based supplements can be used when you want to supplement any time worked over a certain number of hours, per single day of work. It could be used if the employees work more than one shift per day.   For this example, when an employee works over 9 hours in a single day, they will receive double the pay for the extra hours.   Supplement type : Choose Day-based supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Payment period (1) : It can be set to 00:00 ‚Äì 00:00 to include any hours worked on any given day. Payment period (2) : The ‚ÄòFrom‚Äô hours should be set to 9 (overtime threshold) and the ‚ÄòTo‚Äô hours should be set to a maximum (in this case, 24). Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Set the Payroll percentage to 100%, as you want to supplement the pre-existing rate with 100%. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Do not enter 200%, as this would give employees 300% of their wage for the applicable hours. Days of the week : Select the days of the week here. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Contract rules supplement Use Contract rules supplements if you were manually calculating and paying for overtime. For example, you can  set a contract rule  for employees that calculates and pays them automatically if they exceed a certain number of hours.   In the example below, a Contract rules supplement is being applied to all employees having the  Intern 80 Hrs  contract rule whereby their maximum monthly hours should be 80. Exceeding that 80 hours limit would give them ¬£15 extra pay on top of their hourly rate for each hour worked above 80.   Supplement type : Choose Contract rules supplement Contract rule : Select for which Contract rule the supplement should apply. Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description. Hourly wage : Since this will be a fixed increment, select ‚Äò¬£ (monetary)‚Äô. Payment period : For the supplement to kick in after working 80 hours, set the  From  to 0 hours and the  To  to 20 hours paying ¬£15 extra. The  To  value is the maximum number of hours until which the supplement should be applied for. So any hours beyond 80, in this case the extra 20 hours, will be given a ¬£15 supplement on top of the regular pay. Reset frequency : You can select either per day or per contract rule interval. The selected value of  Reset frequency  determines if the overtime rates should reset per day or if they should follow the interval of the contract rule. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Set the monetary increase of ¬£15 to be paid to any hours beyond 80, on top of the hourly wage. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details.   The payroll report would show the contract rule applied when the employee exceeds their 80 scheduled hours threshold. You can see this supplement applied when you export the payroll report from  Payroll  >  Payroll export  >  Prepare report .   Reset frequency - use case In the example below, the employee is contracted to work 25 hours per week but is working 37h 30min from Monday to Friday. The employee then works 12h 30 min overtime.    The following Contract rules supplement is created:    The employee will be paid an additional 100% of the normal rate for overtime hours and the supplement will apply after 2 hours (1.) Reset frequency  is set to Per day (2.), therefore the supplement will trigger when the employee has worked more than 25 hours per week and will apply after 2 hours of overtime  every day .  The supplement will look like this in the payroll report:   If we use the Reset frequency option  Per Contract rule interval , the supplement will trigger when the employee has worked more than 25 hours per week and will apply after 2 hours of overtime, on  all hours  until the next weekly interval starts.        Manual supplement These supplements are used when you manually want to add supplements to your employees, such as bonuses. It applies directly to the shift in the schedule. You can set a fixed amount per shift or per hour. You can create a manual supplement under  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement  >  Manual supplement > Create fixed manual supplement/Create manual supplement. There are two kinds of manual supplements.  The  manual supplement ‚Äî  calculated per hour and the amount can‚Äôt be edited when the supplement is added to the shift. The  fixed manual supplement ‚Äî  calculated for the entire shift and you can edit the amount when you add the supplement to the shift. In the example below, a fixed manual supplement is created for the employees who are on call and who have to come and work extra. They would get a ¬£30 supplement on their ‚ÄúEmergency shift‚Äù.   Name and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description Block normal supplements:  Choose whether or not this supplement should block other supplements Employee groups:  Select which Employee groups this supplement should be applied Shift types:  Select the Shift types where the supplement can apply Employee types:  Select which Employee types this supplement should be applied for Bank Holiday calendar:  If you don‚Äôt select any days of the week further down, choose the Bank holiday calendar the supplement should be applied to Payroll:  Set the monetary increase of ¬£30 to be added to the shift‚Äôs pay Salary code:  Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Days of the week:  Select which days of the week the supplement can be applicable. Valid from/Valid to:  Set when the supplement comes into effect or ends.

Planday simplifies the payroll process and offers many options to ensure your employees are paid correctly, even in complex circumstances. To learn about assigning fixed salaries, please go to  How to set an employee's fixed salary . Set a default wage on an Employee group You can set an hourly wage or wage per shift for employees based on the  Employee group  they belong to. To do so, go to  People >Employee groups . Create  a new Employee group via the blue button in the top right corner, or  edit  an existing group by hovering over the Employee group and clicking on the Edit icon.   From the  Edit employee group  window, set a default hourly wage or a default wage per shift. You also have the option to set a Salary code for the Employee group from here in order to get more finely granulated data in your payroll system. ‚ö†Ô∏è When you assign a default hourly wage, you need to be aware of the following: If you create a new Employee group, the default hourly wage you set will apply to all the employees that you‚Äôll add to this group. If you already have employees added to this group and you want them to have the new default hourly wage, you would need to follow the steps in the part Update your hourly wages in bulk.   Update your hourly wages in bulk To update the hourly wage of the employees in an Employee group in bulk, navigate to  People > Employee Groups   >  Edit the relevant Employee group.   Select the employees that need a wage update. Once you're done selecting, find the Edit wages option at the bottom of the screen ( the pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è).   A new window will open up, where you can set: the wage the wage type and define which date the change will be valid. Finally, click on  Save  and then on  Done  to close the window.    Assign and edit an employee‚Äôs hourly wage üí° To apply hourly wages, you will first need to assign an Employee group (job role) to your employee.  You can learn more about Employee groups here .  When employees are added to an Employee group, they get the default hourly wage set for this group.   You can edit an employee‚Äôs hourly wage by navigating to  People > Employees  (1)   > Click on  the employee‚Äôs name  (2) >   edit the  Employee group  (3) ,  set a wage and choose a valid from date (4).   ‚ö†Ô∏è  The payroll supplements will be applied to the wage input in the field above. Be careful if you choose the wage type Wage per shift, the Supplements don‚Äôt apply on these. You can also edit the hourly wage from the employee‚Äôs full edit profile. Go to  People > Employees > Edit employee >  switch to the  Employment  tab  > Employee groups,  edit the  Employee group,  set a wage and choose a valid from date.   üí° If you can‚Äôt see the hourly wage of an employee, it must be because this employee has the same Access level as you do.   Changing the valid from date of an hourly wage There are a few things to be aware of when you change the valid from date of an hourly wage for an employee.   If the new valid from date is prior to any existing valid from dates, then you‚Äôll be asked if you‚Äôd like to insert the new hourly wage OR overwrite the future hourly wages set for the employee. For example, an employee was paid ¬£15 per hour (valid from 21/12). The employee has another hourly wage: ¬£17 (set to start on 01/05 of the following year). If you make a new update to the wage: ¬£16 and valid from date: 16/03, you‚Äôll have the following message:   If you choose the first option, the employee will get ¬£16 and this change will overwrite the salary that starts on 01-05.   If you choose the second option, the employee will get ¬£16 until the new hourly wage starts, on 01-05. In the example above, option 2 was chosen. The employee gets ¬£16 from 16/03, up until the new hourly wage kicks in, on 01/05.   If you change the hourly wage of an already approved shift, the change will affect this shift. However, the change won‚Äôt affect the shifts that are in a locked payroll period.   See wage history In the wage history you can find information about who changed an employee's wage and when and what the previous wage was. You can go to  People > Employees > Edit employee >  switch to the  Employment  tab  > Employee groups,  edit the  Employee group  and see the wage history by selecting the  Wage history  tab to the right of  Details .

Hours / Payroll  - It is recommended to additionally activate the  Payroll hours & costs  slider. In this case, next to the hours, you will see the total sum of the labour costs of the day. üí° If you have fixed employees, their salary costs will be taken into account here, depending on your allocation settings.

Labour cost share  - The displayed percentage represents your labour cost share for the day. In brackets, you can see a  target value  (which you have defined in the budget). If the value is red üî¥ , you are above the target value. If the value is üü¢ green, you are below it or exactly on target.   On the left side of the revenue bar, you will see a summary of the values for the whole week. In addition, the following calculations are done for  the proportion of salary costs : Target  - your expected share of labour costs, as you entered it when setting up the budget. Actual  - The payroll cost share is calculated based on the daily revenue you have entered. Forecast  - The payroll cost share, calculated based on your deposited sales forecast (when setting up the budget).   Enter your daily sales manually To enter your daily sales forecast, go to the empty fields under each day on the schedule, or navigate to the menu  Reports >  Revenue  >  Per day  and press the link in the Revenue column. To get a more realistic view of your labour costs in relation to revenue, enter your forecast for each day of the week.   Once you've done this, you can see daily expenses as a percentage value. If the value is red, you have exceeded your budgeted costs. If the box is green, you are either on or below your budgeted salary/expense percentage. You can also see what your payroll/expense percentage will be if you reach your projected revenue/sales.   In the Revenue line at the bottom of the screen, you will find a value per date in the Revenue line. Click this and the Daily Revenue edit window will appear (as shown in the image above). üí°  Revenue can only be entered if at least one shift exists on that day. If the date is in the future, you can enter your expected revenue (in local currency) as a forecast here. If the date is in the past and you have revenue data available, you can enter your actual revenue. Optionally, enter a  Cash difference  or a  Note  as a comment. Confirm by clicking  Save .  Update actual sales during the week As the week goes by, you will need to update your schedule by entering the actual sales into the daily revenue tab. This will either increase or decrease your actual labour percentage as the week continues, allowing you to make better decisions on cutting hours or increasing sales to hit your targeted labour budget. üí°  In addition to manual revenue entry, Planday allows synchronising revenue data automatically via integrations with POS systems.

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate meal costs for employees. Meal contributions, or deductions, can be set up to trigger automatically when a Shift exceeds a working time limit. This can ensure employees are compensated for meals or have a specific amount deducted from their payroll to cover meal costs. How to set up Meal contribution and deduction rules The first step is to create a Meal contribution and deduction rule that allows us to administer how much and how often this distribution must happen. Go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Meal contribution and deduction.   Press  Create  to make a contribution or deduction rule.   Type  - Select which rule you want to set up: a  Meal contribution  or a  Meal deduction . A contribution amount adds the specified amount to the employee‚Äôs pay. A deduction amount removed the specified amount from the employee‚Äôs pay.   Amount  - The  Amount  is the monetary value for the contribution/deduction, and this can be set to: Hourly - applied for every hour of a shift. Daily - used once a shift. Required working time  is the minimum working time needed, in minutes, for an employee to receive the contribution/deduction.   Salary code  - Add an optional  Salary code   to quickly identify this in your payroll exports, and choose whether you want your deductions  printed as a positive number. üí° This depends on your payroll system's requirements, so please check the documentation of your integration provider. Lastly, select when this rule should be  valid from  and  to  (optional).   For example, in the screenshot above, employees that work continuously for 360 minutes (6 hours) are entitled to a meal per shift. A meal is ¬£5 per employee and should be deducted from their payroll. Therefore, their meal deduction rule will apply daily, after 360 minutes of required working time, for an amount of ¬£5.

To check this, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplements  > edit the relevant supplement and check the  Valid from/to  indicating   when the supplement comes into effect or ends. The payroll period is unlocked : if you made some changes to a supplement, it won‚Äôt apply to a  locked payroll period. An employee gets two Payroll supplements when only one should be applied When more than one  Payroll supplement  is applied to an employee, but only one should be applied, it may be due to one of the following settings: Enforced payment When  Enforced payment  is enabled for a Payroll supplement, that supplement will always be paid out regardless of the application of other supplements.  If there is more than one supplement applying simultaneously, and  Enforced payment  is disabled for both of them, the one with the highest payment will be paid out.   Holiday Calendar If a  Bank holiday calendar  and  Days of the week  are both selected in the supplement's settings, the supplement is applied twice if there's an overlap.   As an example, if you selected the day Monday and a Bank holiday day falls on a Monday, then the supplement will be applied twice, once because it's a Monday and once because it's a Bank holiday day.   If a supplement is applied on a Bank holiday day, the scheduled hours to which the supplement is applied are the hours used for Payroll, unless the number of hours entered for a Bank holiday day is higher.    You can choose the number of hours for a Bank holiday day by navigating to  Settings  >  Your organisation  >  General  >  Bank Holiday calendar  >  Edit holiday  >  Edit day  > Add value to the field  How many hours is the day .   Combination of automated and manual supplement When using manual supplements in addition to regular supplements (such as Normal or Week-based supplements for example) then employees may be paid double if the criteria overlap. You will need to do the following: Link the Manual supplement to a Shift type (1.). Exclude the Shift type from the regular supplement afterwards (2.). üí° If you can‚Äôt see the Shift type option, reach out to our Support team so we can activate it for you.   Combination of Week-based supplement and Day-based supplement A Week-based supplement and a Day-based supplement can overlap. If you use day-based supplements for overtime hours, you may want to exclude these hours from the Week-based supplement count.  By linking the Day-based supplement to a shift type as shown in the previous example, you can resolve this issue. You would then exclude this Shift type from the Week-based supplement.   Payroll supplements and costs in the Schedule What payroll supplements are included in the payroll costs in the schedule? You may wonder why some supplements are not included in the payroll costs in the Schedule. Week-based supplements, Day-based supplements, Personal supplements and Seniority supplements are not included in the payroll costs in the Schedule because they are spread out across the shifts. Normal supplements, Manual supplements and Contract rules supplements are included in the payroll costs in the Schedule. üí°  Go to  Payroll costs in the Schedule - FAQs  to see what payroll costs are included in the schedule.   Contract rules supplements If there is more than one interval per Contract rule, which interval will be picked? The interval that will be chosen for the Contract rules supplement will be the  Primary interval  that is set in the  Contract rules ‚Äô settings.   The Contract rules supplement is not applied It could be because of the following reasons: The Payment period is wrong:  if the supplement should be applied as soon as the employees exceed their contracted hours, check that the value inserted is 0 in the  From  field in  Payment period .   The  start date of the Contract rule‚Äôs interval  is on another day than Monday.

When changing an employee's pay from hourly to salaried or vice versa, there are a few steps that you should take to ensure a smooth transition. You need to know the pay rates you will be setting and when the changes should occur, depending on when you run payroll. You also need to ensure that the employee doesn't get double paid.

Set a  Salary period  to indicate how the fixed salary is distributed. Payment of salary will still follow the  Pay period .

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents Whether you work in the healthcare industry or use a Payroll integration, automatically including holiday information in Payroll can be a time-saver.   Setting up a fixed leave account  in Planday is a good way to make sure that your employees get a set number of days/hours off paid out per year, according to their contract and Shift types allows you to send your schedule information to Payroll automatically.   The leave is represented as a shift within integrations like Xero, Sage or QuickBooks. This article will help you set up Planday, so leave-related payout can almost work automatically. Configure Employee types Typically, a Leave account (or Absence account) is attached to an  Employee type . An Employee can only be set to one Employee type at a time, so that makes managing leave accounts a bit easier.   Fixed leave accounts are usually connected to Employees with a monthly salary, as it does not provide holiday costs for Payroll. However, this article will show you how to extract the Payroll information from Fixed leave accounts.   In some scenarios, like in the Healthcare industry, leave is calculated based on the individual's weekly contract ( e.g., Annual leave no. of hours = 5.6 x Weekly working hours). This case fits in between what would be standard practice for using either a Fixed leave account (typically used for the salaried Employee types) or an Accrued leave account (often used for Hourly-paid Employee types).   In the healthcare scenario, an employee with a 40-hour workweek contract will need a Fixed leave account of  224 hours .   To make this work, you'll need to set up an Employee type per weekly contract. Go to  Settings  >  People  >  General , and create your  Employee type .   You'll need an Employee type for each kind of contract (below you can see an example for an organization with only two contract types: a 36 hours/week contract and a 40 hours/week contract). This is necessary because the initial balance in the leave account will be different based on the number of hours/week specified in the contract.   Set up Leave accounts After creating the necessary Employee types, go to  Settings > Leave & Overtime  >  Account Templates > Create > Leave account  and create an account for each of your contracts.    Here's an example of a 40 hours/week contract:   Give your leave template a name. You can choose whether this configuration should renew each year automatically.   Using the previous formula (5.6 x weekly working hours), the annual hourly holiday entitlement for this type of contract will be 224 hours per employee, which means that the  Initial value  on this vacation account is  224 , and the  Accruing in mode  should be in  hours .   It is essential to connect the vacation account to the correct Employee type, to ensure that only the employees with the right Employee type are eligible to use this specific Vacation Account.   You can now assign this Leave account to your employees by assigning their correspondent Employee type via the dropdown menu in the Edit employee window. As a reminder, an employee's profile can be found from  People  > click on the name of the employee >  Edit  > and set the  Employee type.   Requesting and booking a vacation Handling Vacation for an hourly member of staff using a Fixed Account is a two-part process. The booking process remains the same: either the employee sends you a Vacation request, or you can book in the Vacation for them, from  Schedule  ‚Üí  Leave requests ( or  Absence requests) .    Choose the employee and the date range. Then mark which days should be 'paid' holiday (and deducted from their account balance), and which days should be 'unpaid' (and have no effect on the account balance).    Here's an example for an employee that regularly works 8 hours per day, Monday to Friday (40 hours/week):   Make sure to take a look at the account balance section, to check whether the calculated deductions are correct:   Leave a message if you want to, and approve the holiday. Then move on to the next step to connect the approved holiday to Payroll.    Pay the approved leave As the vacation request on its own has no links to Payroll, you will need to make that connection through Shifts from your schedule. That way, the correct payment will register automatically.    Go to the  Schedule > Employee view  and find the  Vacation . Remember that you can use  Filters  to see only the employees you need. The view should look like this:   For each day of the Vacation period (marked in the Schedule), you will need to create a Shift that uses a specific  Shift type  (for instance, a Shift type called  Holiday monthly salaried ).   The Shift will need a Start and End time corresponding to the number of hours deducted from the vacation account balance for that day.   In the example with the 40 hours/week employee, each Shift would be 8 hours long.   The Shift type and each Shift will ensure that the payment is calculated correctly and linked to Payroll.   To avoid confusion, you should create a specific Shift type and use it only for Vacation payments. You can read more about how to create and use Shift types here.    When you've finished creating Shifts (of the Vacation Shift type), your schedule should look like this:   As you can see on the left-hand side, underneath the employee's name, they now have 40 hours of Vacation time registered for this week, which will automatically be reported to Payroll.

If an hourly waged employee has a %-based supplement on a shift, the % will be applied to the hourly wage.   For example: An employee has an hourly wage of ¬£14 A 50%-based supplement is set to be applied when a shift is scheduled between 5 pm and 7 pm The employee has a shift from 9 am - 7 pm and the supplement applies for 2 hours There‚Äôs an unpaid break of 30 minutes and the supplement is affected by the break This would give the daily cost of ¬£147 The calculation is as follows:  Daily wage: ¬£14 * 9.5 (number of hours worked) = ¬£133 Supplement: ¬£14 * 0.5 * 2 = ¬£14 Total daily cost with the supplement: ¬£133 + ¬£14 = ¬£147 How do the salary allocation methods work with Shift type adjustments? The rate adjustments will not be based on the salary allocation method. It will use the value that is  Salary amount / Expected working hours. If a salaried employee has a shift with a %-based Shift type adjustment, this will be displayed in the schedule‚Äôs payroll costs using the same calculation as in payroll.  Example with a  200% rate adjustment : an employee earns ¬£2500 a month and is expected to work 150 hours per month salary allocation method is set to Business days a 200% rate adjustment is set on a Shift type called ‚ÄúOvertime‚Äù the employee has a shift of 8 hours on Tuesday, with this Shift type this would give the daily cost of ¬£246.96 The calculation is as follows: Total daily cost: 2500/22 (number of business days within the current month) = ¬£113.63 Rate adjustment: ¬£2500/150 = ¬£16.67 *8 (number of worked hours) = ¬£133.33 Total with the rate adjustment included: ¬£113.63 + ¬£133.33 = ¬£246.96 Example with a  50% rate adjustment : Total daily cost: 2500/22 (number of business days within the current month) = ¬£113.63 Rate adjustment: ¬£2500/150 = ¬£16.66 * 0.5 = 8.333 * 8 (number of hours in the shift) = ¬£66.67 Total with the rate adjustment deducted: ¬£113.63 - ¬£66.67 = ¬£46.97 With a  0% rate adjustment :  In the schedule, the amount is deducted from the salary allocation In the payroll report, the amount will be deducted from the salary. This amount is based on the calculation:  Salary amount / Expected working hours  * the number of hours in the shift. How do the wages work with Shift type adjustments? For example, let's consider a waged employee who earns ¬£12 per hour. On Tuesday, the shift type Overtime is set to 200%, resulting in a rate adjustment of 200%. This means the employee earns ¬£192 instead of the usual ¬£96 for that day. Similarly, on Friday, an additional ¬£2 supplement is added to the regular payroll. This increases the employee's earnings to ¬£112 (¬£96 + ¬£2 * 8).   The payroll costs are higher than I expected. What could be the reason for this? There could be several reasons for this: There are  additional payroll costs  in the schedule. To check this, go to  Settings > Revenue > Additional payroll costs . The  salary of one or more employees hasn‚Äôt been allocated correctly . To check this, check the salary setup of your salaried employees, in the  Employment  tab in their profile and make the necessary changes.  The Payroll costs are lower than I expected. What could be the reason for this? There could be several reasons for this: The hourly wage of an employee has been recently updated but the date selected for the new wage to be valid is incorrect. To check this and update the hourly wage, go to  How to set and update your employees‚Äô hourly wages . Manual unpaid breaks  have been added to some shifts. This can happen if you‚Äôve entered manual breaks in the template and you roll it out. Then, both the manual breaks and the automatic breaks will be applied. The option  Count hours in payroll report  has been disabled for a  Shift Type  and the hours are not counting towards the worked hours, nor the total payroll costs. Custom Hourly rate/Wage per shift was entered for one or more shifts My salary percentage is lower than I expected. Why? One of the most common reasons is that one or more positions are not included in the payroll percentage. To check this:  go to the Positions view in the schedule (1) edit a position (2) scroll down and toggle the button  Affects payroll percentage  if needed (3). I can‚Äôt see the costs. Why? There could be several reasons for this. Make sure that the option  Payroll hours & costs  is toggled on in the schedule If you have enabled the option and still can‚Äôt see the costs, contact your manager. It could be that you don‚Äôt have permission to see the payroll costs If you still can‚Äôt see the costs, you can reach out to our Support Team and they will help you fix the issue.  Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For admins looking for alignment on processing payroll. What is a pay period? The  pay period  determines how often the employee will be paid both hourly and fixed salaries.   You can set a pay period for each employee by going to  People  >  Edit employee  >  Employment  >  Pay periods . The default pay period is  Monthly , which is pre-selected for all your employees unless you change it.   When processing your payroll from  Payroll  >  Payroll export , you can select which pay periods to include in your report.   Which pay period should you set? You probably already have a pay period that works for your business and your region‚Äôs market requirements. Besides the default  Monthly  option, Employees may prefer to be paid more frequently on a  weekly  or  fortnightly  schedule giving them quick budgeting possibilities. However, it can be time-consuming to have to run payroll at a more frequent interval if you have many employees.   You have the following options to choose from when setting a pay period: Monthly  - (default) - Employees get their hourly salary calculated for the month or earn a fixed income. This option is suitable for fixed-salaried employees. Fortnightly  - also known as  bi-weekly  or  every other week pay period . Employees get their hourly salary calculated for two weeks. This option is suitable for hourly paid employees. Weekly  - You can use this to pay your hourly or fixed-salaried employees on a weekly basis. Four-weekly  - You can choose this option if you pay your employees after four weeks (as opposed to every calendar month). This option is suitable for hourly paid employees. How to set or change an employee‚Äôs pay period? While choosing a pay period when starting a new business may be easy, changing to a new period for existing employees can also be accomplished very quickly. You can change an employee‚Äôs pay period by navigating to  People  >  Employees  > click the name of the employee and press  Edit  > go to  Employment  tab > scroll down to the  Pay period  section. üí° When changing a pay period, you must specify when that pay period should come into effect. Set this by selecting a future date under  Valid from.  The change will go into effect from 00:00 of the selected day.   How to set or change an employee‚Äôs Salary? You can set or change an employee's salary by navigating to  People  >  Employees  > click the name of the employee and press  Edit  > go to  Employment  tab > scroll down to the  Salary  section > press  Edit salary .   Exporting specific pay periods in Payroll export To process your payroll for specific pay periods, go to  Payroll  >  Payroll export  page.   Here you can choose a  pay period  by deselecting the ones you don't need depending on your payroll need. Select a  Date interval  to prepare your report.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins new to Planday. Need to  manage and approve Punch Clock entries ?   What is Punch Clock? In Planday, you can record the presence and punctuality of employees with the  Punch Clock  functionality and prepare your payroll by approving shifts. Employees can use the Planday app to clock in and out. However, if required, you can release the function exclusively for use in a web browser via  PunchClock.Planday.com Set up Punch Clock for use on a web browser Register your IP addresses This solution allows employees to punch in and out using a web browser by visiting  PunchClock.Planday.com  from their work premises. Access to this functionality requires an administrator of your Planday account to register the IP address from which to use the Punch Clock at work.   Follow these steps to enable this functionality: Log in to your Planday account from a computer on a network your employees will be clocking in and out. Navigate to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  section >  Employee Access , then  Web access  section > Add. Your  Current IP  address will be displayed here. Add this address if you are on the network where your employees will be clocking in and out. Enter the desired IP address under  Add IP . You can also provide a name and description. Example: Hafenstrasse location / This is the address of our caf√© on Hafenstrasse. Confirm by clicking on  Save . After the IP address is registered, your employees can punch in and out via  PunchClock.Planday.com  using their email address and password, provided they are connected to the internet via the registered IP address (WLAN network).   If you operate in  multiple locations , you can also add the IP addresses of these locations. This ensures that employees can also clock in and out there.   What to do if your IP address is not recognized If you cannot access  PunchClock.Planday.com , your dynamic IP address has probably changed or you. Many internet service providers change their dynamic IP addresses from time to time. You may need to update your IP address in Punch Clock.   See the guidance above or follow this article on  registering your IP address  to edit your existing list or register more addresses. Alternate: Use Punch Clock activation codes if you use dynamic IP addresses See the article on  Setting activation code for Punch Clock . Alternate: Make punching in faster using PIN codes instead of passwords See the article on  Using PIN codes for web Punch Clock .   Set up Punch Clock for use via the Planday app Configure mobile app access Here's how to proceed if you want to give your employees access to the Punch Clock via the Planday app: Navigate to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  section >  Employee Access  >  Mobile   App Access  section. Select  Yes  for  Punch Clock used in mobile app  and check ‚òëÔ∏è  Punch Clock allowed in certain physical locations.  Set up geofencing for access through the mobile app Geofencing is used so employees can only punch in and out if they are physically present in an area. Employees must stay in a predefined workplace; otherwise, they will not be allowed to punch in or out of their shifts. To set up, click  Add new location . Navigate to the map view. Enter your address in the search bar or drag and drop the location pin to the suitable place of your location. Set up your geofencing radius by dragging the arrow icon. Planday recommends a radius of at least 100 meters, as a smaller radius may be affected by the smartphone's GPS accuracy or GPS interference in the area. Add the Departments whose employees can punch in and out of this location. Give the location a name. Confirm by clicking on  Save . üí°  After setting up your location, employees can only clock in and out if they are within the specified radius and have GPS turned on their smartphone. For the Punch Clock to work through the app, Planday requires GPS or Location access - This is used solely to punch in and out, not to track locations or otherwise. Give employees unrestricted access to clocking in and out If clocking in from a physical geo-location is not essential for your business, you can set the Punch Clock to let your employees clock in without being at a location or connected to your WIFI.    To enable this option, check ‚òëÔ∏è  Punch Clock allowed everywhere.   Allow employees to punch in for an unscheduled shift You can allow your employees to punch in without a shift assigned to them. If an employee punches in without a shift, their hours will be visible on the schedule for the department they clock in, and you can administer or approve the shift like any other shift.    Go to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Display settings  and select  Yes  to  Punch in without a shift.   Limit the use of the Punch Clock to the Wi-Fi network at work It is also possible to allow the Punch Clock to be used via the app when employees use the WIFI at their workplace without relying on geolocation. An IP address must be specified for this. To enable this option, check ‚òëÔ∏è  Punch Clock allowed from the workplace Wi-Fi . üí° If your employees are using iOS devices running iOS14 or later, the Planday app will require location services to be enabled to punch in and out.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents To help you stay on top of your tasks and have all the information you need to keep your staff safe, we added the  Punch Clock  feature that allows you to set up a quick survey feature to do a health check for your employees before they start a shift.    This is meant to give your employees a quick and easy way to inform you of their well-being and will help you keep your staff safe, which can be particularly relevant in the current COVID-19 landscape.   The Health check appears as a pop-up when an employee starts a Shift in Punch Clock, asking whether they present any symptoms or have been in recent contact with someone who has Covid-19 or is exhibiting symptoms.  If either situation is applicable, you'll be notified immediately through a Planday message. Your employee will be advised to self-isolate and contact you and their healthcare provider for the next steps.   Here is an example of how the pop-up looks in the mobile app.   The Health check is only available through Punch Clock. If you're not currently using Punch Clock, you can contact our support team for assistance (from the messaging icon in the bottom right corner) or follow this quick  guide  to set it up.    When enabled, the Health check will appear across all platforms you might use within your organization for Punch Clock - be it web, the mobile app, or the Kiosk app.  The health check will be shown every time one of your employees start a new shift.    Enable the Health Check You'll have to navigate to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Survey  to set it up. If you want to use the Health check and cannot find the entry in the side menu, please reach out to our support team to have it enabled.    The Survey for Punch Clock is by default disabled, giving you the option to decide whether it's something relevant for your organization.  Please note that the current format is preset and mainly relevant for the current COVID-19 context.    To enable the Survey, simply toggle on the two options.  The first will enable the pop-up to show before an employee starts a shift and the second will ensure that a notification is sent - when needed, as soon as an employee answers.    The notification will be sent as a message through Planday (and an email if that is how you've configured your communication settings).  You can read more about  messaging through Planday app .   The message will contain information about the  employee  that attempted to punch in and which  shift  they wanted to start.    This message will be received by the employee's direct  Supervisor  (as set up on your Planday), managers for the Kiosk app, and any user with an  HR manager  permission.  If you are using custom security groups and permissions on your Planday, you should be aware that the notification might be sent to all the users that have access to edit an employee's details.

Before using this feature, please  register your IP address for Punch Clock web access . Managing the  Punch Clock  can become complex as the number of employees, departments, locations or devices increases. Several employees may want to punch in and out at the same time, you may want to make more devices available at different locations, or you may want to ensure that employees do not see the names and shift times of other colleagues.   Punch Clock kiosk profiles  allow you to customise Punch Clock for the web for different devices used across multiple locations where several employees punch in and out.   For example, you can create  Punch Clock kiosk profiles  for individual devices that allow department-specific employees to punch in to make the login experience quick and efficient. A profile always consists of a name, assigned departments and a method for identifying employees. This lets you filter and customise the Punch Clock experience for only the employees that need to log in from that device.   You can set up the Punch Clock so that it can only be used in specific locations or on certain networks. You can learn more about this in the article  Set up your Punch Clock . üí° Note that the use of the Planday app remains unaffected by kiosk profiles. To enable the use of Punch Clock via the app, go to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Employee access  >  Mobile App Access  >  Punch Clock used in mobile app  >  Yes . The kiosk profiles are only valid on the devices to which they are assigned and used on the web login function via PunchClock.Planday.com. Create a Punch Clock kiosk profile Navigate to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  section >  Profiles . From there, click  Create Profile  button.   Name  - Choose a descriptive name for the profile that suits you best. Planday recommends an intuitive name related to the department or location for time tracking. For example, if you want to create two separate kiosk profiles for two restaurants at different locations, the following would be conceivable: Restaurant1 time recording / Restaurant2 time recording. Departments  - You can assign one or more departments to the profile. This can be useful if you want to group and filter the employees using this profile. A department can also be added to multiple profiles if necessary. Employees from departments you do not assign to the kiosk profile will be unable to use it to clock in and out. Employee identification method  - You can specify the method employees must use to identify themselves on this profile when recording time. Here you can choose between  Username  and  Employee overview. The  Username  option requires employees to enter their username and password before being allowed to punch in. The employee view at  PunchClock.Planday.com  is shown in the screenshot below. The  Employee overview  option displays a list of employees who have a scheduled shift for the day. Employees can select themselves from this list and punch in. Unlike the first option, the username will already be taken from this overview. The employee view at  PunchClock.Planday.com  is shown in the screenshot below. üí° Note that with this option, all employees who have access to the Punch Clock device may see the name and shift times of other employees using this kiosk profile. After setting up the Punch Clock preference, press  Save  to confirm. Assign a Punch Clock kiosk profile to your device Created kiosk profiles can now be assigned to specific devices. Provide your employees with a stationary device such as a computer, tablet or laptop, and give this device to the appropriate profile. Navigate to  PunchClock.Planday.com  on the desired device and log in. Please follow the steps regarding web setup in the  Set up your Punch Clock  article if you haven't set up a Punch Clock yet. üí° If you want to enable punching in and out with a stationary iPad, the Planday Kiosk app may be an alternate solution. Learn more in the article  Planday Kiosk app for iPad . Follow the steps below to assign a kiosk profile to the kiosk app. At the top right of the  PunchClock.Planday.com  home screen, click the Settings icon ‚öôÔ∏è. Only users with admin privileges can change the settings. If you need a different configuration, please contact our support team.   The  Punch Clock kiosk profiles  you created in Planday settings will appear in the Profiles area (see graphic, area 1.). Press  Assign  to set the kiosk profile to the device you are currently on. Give your device a descriptive name in the area on the right (2.) such as a  Kitchen tablet .   The setup is complete with the assignment of the kiosk profiles to the desired devices. You can always readjust the settings as needed. ‚ö†Ô∏è If a kiosk profile assigned to a device does not include some departments, employees from those departments will not see their shifts on this device. To ensure the functionality of the Punch Clock and to avoid errors, make sure of the following: The device used for punching in and clocking out should be set to the correct time. This applies to shared devices such as tablets, computers or laptops and employees' devices. Your web browser should be up to date if you plan on using it as a Punch Clock solution.

If you want to enforce limitations or contractual obligations in your schedule, you should consider the  Contract rules feature  instead. What is a Working time rule? Working time rules  are used to set up guidelines for how to schedule your employees. You can for instance create a rule that says employees are not supposed to work more than 9 hours in a row. If you create a shift longer than 9 hours, a warning will pop up in the schedule, notifying you that you‚Äôve broken the rule at which point you‚Äôll be able to make the appropriate changes.    This way, you can monitor if your schedule fits within the guidelines you have set up. A working time rule  cannot  block you from creating or assigning a shift, even if it breaks its guidelines. How to set up a Working time rule? To set up a working time rule, you'll first need to create one starting from a structure that fits your needs best.   Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Working time rules  >  Create Working time rule .   This will open a new window for you to choose which type of rule you want to start setting up. Click on  Working time rules - Use cases  to see all the working time rules you can create and some examples.   Setting up any of the rule types will require that you:  Set a name for the rule . With this name, you will be able to distinguish between all the rules set up for your organization, in the overview list.  Chose who and what it applies to  within your organization. You can define this through:  Employee groups Employee types Shift types  -  By default, a rule will apply to all Shift types. The setup form allows you to select which Shift types to exclude. You cannot exclude all the shift types because the working time rule needs at least one parameter to know which Shifts to take into account, from your schedule. Click  Create  when you're happy with the setup   ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  Above is an example of the setup form for a working time rule that can be used to monitor shift length. See the Working time rule warning in the Schedule ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Once the rule is active, it will automatically trigger a warning on the next conflicting shift you create or modify in the schedule.   The working time rule cannot block you from creating or editing a shift, which is why you can choose to: Edit shift  to align it with the working time rule guidelines. Cancel  creating the shift (or dismissing the changes that triggered the warning). Ignore  the rule conflict warning and create the shift.   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins new to Planday. Need to  manage and approve Punch Clock entries ?   What is Punch Clock? In Planday, you can record the presence and punctuality of employees with the  Punch Clock  functionality and prepare your payroll by approving shifts. Employees can use the Planday app to clock in and out. However, if required, you can release the function exclusively for use in a web browser via  PunchClock.Planday.com Set up Punch Clock for use on a web browser Register your IP addresses This solution allows employees to punch in and out using a web browser by visiting  PunchClock.Planday.com  from their work premises. Access to this functionality requires an administrator of your Planday account to register the IP address from which to use the Punch Clock at work.   Follow these steps to enable this functionality: Log in to your Planday account from a computer on a network your employees will be clocking in and out. Navigate to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  section >  Employee Access , then  Web access  section > Add. Your  Current IP  address will be displayed here. Add this address if you are on the network where your employees will be clocking in and out. Enter the desired IP address under  Add IP . You can also provide a name and description. Example: Hafenstrasse location / This is the address of our caf√© on Hafenstrasse. Confirm by clicking on  Save . After the IP address is registered, your employees can punch in and out via  PunchClock.Planday.com  using their email address and password, provided they are connected to the internet via the registered IP address (WLAN network).   If you operate in  multiple locations , you can also add the IP addresses of these locations. This ensures that employees can also clock in and out there.   What to do if your IP address is not recognized If you cannot access  PunchClock.Planday.com , your dynamic IP address has probably changed or you. Many internet service providers change their dynamic IP addresses from time to time. You may need to update your IP address in Punch Clock.   See the guidance above or follow this article on  registering your IP address  to edit your existing list or register more addresses. Alternate: Use Punch Clock activation codes if you use dynamic IP addresses See the article on  Setting activation code for Punch Clock . Alternate: Make punching in faster using PIN codes instead of passwords See the article on  Using PIN codes for web Punch Clock .   Set up Punch Clock for use via the Planday app Configure mobile app access Here's how to proceed if you want to give your employees access to the Punch Clock via the Planday app: Navigate to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  section >  Employee Access  >  Mobile   App Access  section. Select  Yes  for  Punch Clock used in mobile app  and check ‚òëÔ∏è  Punch Clock allowed in certain physical locations.  Set up geofencing for access through the mobile app Geofencing is used so employees can only punch in and out if they are physically present in an area. Employees must stay in a predefined workplace; otherwise, they will not be allowed to punch in or out of their shifts. To set up, click  Add new location . Navigate to the map view. Enter your address in the search bar or drag and drop the location pin to the suitable place of your location. Set up your geofencing radius by dragging the arrow icon. Planday recommends a radius of at least 100 meters, as a smaller radius may be affected by the smartphone's GPS accuracy or GPS interference in the area. Add the Departments whose employees can punch in and out of this location. Give the location a name. Confirm by clicking on  Save . üí°  After setting up your location, employees can only clock in and out if they are within the specified radius and have GPS turned on their smartphone. For the Punch Clock to work through the app, Planday requires GPS or Location access - This is used solely to punch in and out, not to track locations or otherwise. Give employees unrestricted access to clocking in and out If clocking in from a physical geo-location is not essential for your business, you can set the Punch Clock to let your employees clock in without being at a location or connected to your WIFI.    To enable this option, check ‚òëÔ∏è  Punch Clock allowed everywhere.   Allow employees to punch in for an unscheduled shift You can allow your employees to punch in without a shift assigned to them. If an employee punches in without a shift, their hours will be visible on the schedule for the department they clock in, and you can administer or approve the shift like any other shift.    Go to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Display settings  and select  Yes  to  Punch in without a shift.   Limit the use of the Punch Clock to the Wi-Fi network at work It is also possible to allow the Punch Clock to be used via the app when employees use the WIFI at their workplace without relying on geolocation. An IP address must be specified for this. To enable this option, check ‚òëÔ∏è  Punch Clock allowed from the workplace Wi-Fi . üí° If your employees are using iOS devices running iOS14 or later, the Planday app will require location services to be enabled to punch in and out.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents Punch Clock deviation rules can help you automate some administrative tasks for shifts that differ from their scheduled punch times. Once you have configured the rules, Planday keeps track of your employee's hours and the changes between their actual and scheduled hours. The deviations will show as suggestions along the rest of the shift in the  Punch Clock approval  to be approved by an admin or schedule manager.   With deviation rules, you can configure Planday to automatically: differentiate the hours worked before or after the scheduled hours. track and calculate the average of the deviations in working hours, for each employee, over time. calculate the effect on salary at the end of a salary period for each employee. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Note that using  Rounding rules  in your Punch Clock may conflict with applying deviation rules. You may need to turn them off or configure Rounding rules to start only with carefully calculated durations. How to create a deviation rule To begin with, create a deviation rule by going to   Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Deviations from scheduled time  >  Create Configure a deviation type After pressing  Create , you can choose which scenarios you want to track and what to happen when the selected scenario occurs. You can make changes later if the initial setup does not suit your scheduling needs.   Name  - This will be used as the name in the deviation rules list.   Deviation type  -   The different deviation types describe different scenarios where you can define what should happen when the scenario occurs. Below you can read more about what the different types are used for. Arrives early  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between punching in before and the scheduled start time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching in happens at 9:30 am, rules of this type will affect the time from 9:30 am to 10 am. Arrives late  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between the scheduled start time and punching in later than the planned time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching in happens at 10:30 am, rules of this type will affect the time from 10 am to 10:30 am. Leaves early  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between punching out and the scheduled end time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching out happens at 5:30 pm, rules of this type will affect the time from 5:30 pm to 6 pm. Leaves late  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between the scheduled end time and punching out. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching out happens at 6:30 pm, rules of this type will affect the time from 6 pm to 6:30 pm. Shift length not reached  determines what should happen when an employee hasn‚Äôt been at work long enough on a given day. The timesheet must have a start and end time to calculate the shift length for this type. This type matches if the punch time length is less than the actual shift length.  This type is not affected by the placement of the shift and the Punch Clock entry. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4 pm, the employee has been working for the correct 8 hours and rules of this type will not generate any deviations. On the other hand, if the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 3:30 pm, 30 minutes of work is missing and rules of this type will generate a deviation from 3:30 pm to 4 pm. Shift length exceeded  is used to determine what should happen when an employee has been at work for too long on a given day. For this type, the shift must have a start and end time to calculate the shift length. This type matches if the punch time length is greater than the actual shift length.  This type is not affected by the placement of the shift and the punch time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4 pm, the employee has been working for the correct 8 hours and rules of this type will not generate any deviations. On the other hand, if the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4:30 pm, the employee has been working 30 minutes extra and rules of this type will generate a deviation from 4 pm to 4:30 pm. üí°  Note that rules concerning  shift length  always have the  highest priority  compared to other types. When a rule related to the shift length has been matched with a shift, all other rules will be ignored for this shift. Final shift type  - Defines the  Shift type  that will be applied to the new shift made by the deviation. For example, if an employee stamps out too late, it can generate overtime according to a deviation rule. See the example below for this use case. Minimum length  - Defines the minimum number of minutes the deviation must be before this rule processes it. 0 means that the rule affects all deviations. Start of shift  - Defines from where in a deviation this rule should start, as time in minutes. 0 means that the rule should apply to the whole deviation. Length  - Defines how long a deviation of this rule should be treated as time in minutes. 60 would mean 1hr.  Depending on your requirements, you can limit your Deviation rules to only apply under certain conditions. You can set them using the following settings. By default, the rule applies to  All  shifts and employees. Shift types  - Apply the rule only to specific  Shift types .  Departments  - Apply the deviation rule only to certain  Departments . Employee groups  - Limit the deviation to only certain groups of employees by selecting an  Employee group . Employee types  - Apply the rule only to some  Employee types . Remember to press  Save  and continue the same process for all desired Deviation rules you create. Example of a shift length exceeded deviation rule  To show how deviation rules work in practice, here is an example with the type  Shift length exceeded .   First, the rule is created by going to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Deviations from scheduled time  >  Create .    This deviation type is used when you want to specify what should happen when an employee has been at work for too long. You want to count his hours towards an overtime account by applying a Shift type, a final shift type is chosen here that provides overtime, ie. ‚Äú+‚Äù, On the Time Off Account.    In this example, the  Shift type   Flex + (100% ) is applied and it is set to generate overtime as defined under  Settings  >  Absence  >  General .   The  Minimum length  is set to 15. This is the minimum number of minutes the shift must be exceeded before the rule takes effect.   The  length  is set to 120 minutes which indicates that the rule is valid for up to 2 hours.   Example shift with deviation rule applied in Punch Clock & Schedule In the following example, the employee has a shift from 16:00-21:00. He stamps in 30 minutes before the start of the shift and stamps out 35 minutes after the end time of the shift. This gives a total of 1 hour and 5 minutes affected by the above deviation rule. Under  Schedule  >  Punch Clock,  you can see how the shift is divided up if the deviation rule is used. The first 5 hours have the shift type Normal and the remaining time of 1.05 hours has automatically been given the shift type Overtime (Flex +). According to the setup, this type of shift will generate additional time for the timeoff account if an administrator approves the deviation. In the Punch Clock overview, the shift before approval will look like this where 5 hours are considered as normal scheduled hours and the extra 1.05 hours are split and counted as overtime. On the  Punch Clock approval  page, you can choose whether you want to use the deviation rule by selecting between Yes or No before approving the hours for pay. When the shift is approved, you can see the division in the shift schedule as shown below: Need more help?   Please search for answers in the üîç  Help Center  or watch our ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  video tutorials .

Please contact Planday support team if you want to enable the Activation codes feature bypassing the IP addresses for your Web Punch Clock.   If you‚Äôd like to use the Punch Clock with a fixed IP address, see how to  add/update your IP address here.    What is a Punch Clock Activation code? A Punch Clock Activation code is a unique identifier that‚Äôs created once a device is activated with it. It is stored on the device itself.   Punch Clock Activation Codes enable you to set up access to  PunchClock.Planday.com  on specific devices on locations with  dynamic IP addresses  (fixed IP is not required).   This will enable you to set up a tablet of any kind or web browser with the  Web Punch Clock  interface, allowing your employees to punch in.    Please contact Planday support team if you want to enable the Activation codes feature bypassing the IP addresses for your Web Punch Clock. Once enabled, you will see the ability to generate activation codes for Punch Clock profiles. See below how to generate them. How can I set up a Punch Clock Activation code? ‚ö†Ô∏è  Before setting up your Activation codes, you must create one or more  Punch Clock profiles  on your Planday account. To set your device as a Punch Clock station, follow these steps: Go to  Settings  (1.) >  Punch Clock  >  Profiles  (2.) Hover your mouse on the right of your Punch Clock profile and click on the  Activation Code  icon (3.) Copy the Activation Code in the popup (4.) Open up  punchclock.planday.com/activate   on the device you want to set up and submit the code If the device has already been set up using an activation code, you‚Äôll be redirected to  punchclock.planday.com  for users to punch in. If the device has not been set up, you‚Äôll be redirected to  punchclock.planday.com/activate  to set up the device with an Activation Code.    The device is now set up, allowing employees to access Punch Clock via  PunchClock.Planday.com . üí°  Please note that when Punch Clock Activation Codes are used for multiple locations/Departments, the same validation method must be used for all locations, so  either  IP validation  or  Punch Clock Activation Codes validation. FAQs How can multiple devices be set up for the same department? To have multiple devices with the same department, you need to create multiple  Punch Clock profiles  (one Punch Clock profile = one device). Some of my Departments use a fixed IP address while others use a dynamic IP address. What do I do? When Punch Clock Activation Codes are used for multiple locations/Departments, the same validation method must be used for all locations, so  either  IP validation  or  Punch Clock Activation Codes validation. You would then need to use: either IP validation and  set different fixed IPs  for your Departments or Punch Clock Activation Codes validation and set all your Departments with one profile for each. What happens when a Punch Clock profile is deactivated? You need to reset the activation code by following the steps described in  How can I set up a Punch Clock Activation Code .

How to choose the right Working time rule? When choosing a working time rule to fit your scheduling needs, you should first narrow down what the rule needs to monitor. Currently, you can choose between the following rule structures that are based on tracking  working hours : tracking of  working hours  such as: Duration of the shift Working hours for a period of time tracking  working days  (days with at least one shift) such as: Number of working days in a calendar week Number of consecutive working days Working days in a period of time Repeating a shift type in a period of time tracking  time off  (between scheduled shifts)  such as: Group of days off in a period of time Hours off between shifts Continuous hours off in a period of time Time off after consecutive shifts If you need to use one of the rule structures above and can't find it listed under  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Working time rules , please contact our support team for assistance.     See the available types of Working time rules   Under  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Working time rules  >  Create,  you can find a list of the working time rules you can choose from and apply to your Planday set-up. ‚¨áÔ∏è   Common Working time rules and examples   Shift duration per day Here you can set a  maximum number of hours  that a shift can be scheduled. You can choose which employee groups and employee types this rule should apply in case you need to create multiple rules. In the following example, no employee should work more than 11 hours excluding any shifts marked as Annual leave.   Working days in a calendar week Here you can define the maximum number of days an employee can work in a given week.  In the following example, no employee should work more than 6 days a week excluding the shifts marked as Annual Leave.    Consecutive working days If you want to set how many  days in a row  an employee can work after which they should be forced to have an off, you can apply a  Consecutive working days  rule. In the following example, employees can have 6 successive shifts without an off day, after which they should have a gap between their scheduled shifts.   Maximum hours per week/day If you have a requirement that certain employees work a limited number of hours per week or day, you can use the  Working hours in a period of time  rule and set a maximum value to it. In the following example, all FOH staff, regardless of their department, should not work more than 48 hours a week.   When you specify a week period in the  Within a period of  field, the hours are calculated starting from the date the shift is created and continuing for one week ahead, rather than from Monday to Sunday. üí° If you choose the rule type  Working days in a period of time , you can choose the maximum working days in a custom period of time. Minimum hours per week/day If you want to set a minimum number of scheduled hours for an employee group, you can apply the  Working hours in a period of time  rule. You can set the period by weeks or days. In the following example, Receptionists are guaranteed a minimum of 28 regular working hours per week.    When you specify a week period in the  Within a period of  field, the hours are calculated starting from the date the shift is created and continuing for one week ahead, rather than from Monday to Sunday.

Set up  automatic break rules  to automatically apply breaks either at a specific time of day or after a set amount of time has been worked.   Set up automatic Break rules Set up automatic break rules to automatically apply breaks either at a specific time of day or after a set amount of time has been worked. For both  Time of day  and  Time after start  breaks, you can determine the following: The name of the break How long a shift must be before an employee receives a break. The days it applies to. If the break should be paid or unpaid. The Department(s), Employee group(s) and Employee types the break applies to.   Setting up automatic breaks based on time of the day   First, go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Break rules  and click on  Add break.  ‚¨ÜÔ∏è To add a break at a specific time of day, click  Add break , and select the  Time of day  break type. Give your break a name, set how long the shift must be for this break to be applicable and set when the break should start and end. ‚¨áÔ∏è     Setting up automatic breaks based on time after start of a shift If you need to give employees a break after working a certain amount of time, go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Breaks , press  Add break , then choose the  Time after start  break rule. Specify the break length, then decide how far into the shift the break should begin and if it should be paid or unpaid.     Setting up multiple automatic break rules If you want to set up multiple break rules that occur throughout the day, we recommend that you have the longest shift possible in mind and add all the breaks accordingly.  Follow the steps described above to create your first break rule of the day For the following break(s), add only the additional break time and not the total break time. The breaks will accumulate. For example, if you want to give your employees one 10-minute paid break if the shift is 4 hours and another 10-minute paid break if the shift is 7 hours, configure this as two separate break rules:   Break rule 1 :     Break rule 2 :   This will result in 2 x 10 min paid breaks, a total of 20 minutes if the shift is 7 hours or longer.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins and Schedule Managers.  Setup Punch Clock  to make full use of this feature. What are Punch Clock rounding rules? In Planday, you can enable rounding rules for the Punch Clock. Rounding, in this case, means rounding up or down the actual time your employees clocked in or clocked out to a ""round"" time - such as 9:00 instead of 08:56.   For example, an employee has a planned shift from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, shows up before the shift starts and punches in at 8:56 am for work. If a corresponding rounding rule is activated, the system automatically suggests the employee's start time as 9:00 - so it would be rounded up. Before approving shifts, you will always have the opportunity to change the times - active rounding rules only help you with suggestions which are not final. You can adapt the rounding rules according to the usual practices in your company. üí° Please note that the Rounding rules can only be combined with the Punch Clock. You can learn more about  Setting up your Punch Clock . The basics of rounding settings Rounding settings make approval of time sheets faster and more accurate. It is especially useful for cases where the scheduled hours aren't necessarily what will be approved for payroll.   For example, if employees are required to clock in or out within 10 minutes of their shift, the Rounding settings can be set up to reflect that. You can also combine multiple Rounding settings to create a more robust set of suggestions. You can access rounding settings via  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Rounding settings .    There are two different rounding rules that you can set: Common rules  - Set common rules for how Punch Clock entries change when employees punch in or out earlier or later than their Shift times. Custom rules  - Custom rules replace common rules and allow you to set advance rule settings, allowing you to limit them by Departments, Employee groups, or Employee types.  How to set up common rounding rules Common rounding rules define how punch times are rounded if employees punch in or out earlier or later than their scheduled time.   Below are some settings you can set as  Common rules :   For both the Start and End times, you can choose from the following rounding methods. No rounding, show punch time  - By default, Planday will show the employees' punched times both for the start and end time and pay them by the minute. No rounding, show shift time  - If your employees usually get paid based on their scheduled hours, you can change the settings to  No rounding, show shift time . Round down  - This option would round down to the nearest 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 or 60 minutes of the punch time. This option is useful if you always trim down the punch time to the nearest round value. Round up  - This option would round up to the nearest 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 or 60 minutes of the punch time. This option is useful if you are always trimming up the punch time to the nearest round value. The basic settings are for Start and End times, but to build a more robust set of rules, you can create  Custom rules  giving you more control over the rounding behaviour and limiting the application to specific employees. üí°  Please note that if you have set Custom rounding rules, they will take priority over the Common rules. How to set up custom rounding rules If you create  Custom rules , these rules will override your Common rounding rules. The Custom rules can be combined with filtering on other variables, such as Departments and Employee groups, as well as being set to apply for a set number of minutes starting from scheduled times.   Press  Create , and after you give the rule a  name .    Type  - You can then choose between the following rule types: Punched in : Clock-ins, with no regard to scheduled times  Punched out : Clock-outs, with no regard to scheduled times Punched in early : Clock-ins, registered before the scheduled start time Punched in late : Clock-ins, registered after the scheduled start time Punched out early : Clock-outs, registered before the scheduled end time Punched out late : Clock-outs, registered after the scheduled end time Rounding method  - Choose what you want to happen to the times affected by the rule. No rounding: This shows the time the employee clocked in or out Round down: Rounds down to the nearest 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes Round up: Rounds up to the nearest 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes Round to nearest: Rounds up or down to the nearest 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes No rounding, show shift time: Shows the originally scheduled time No rounding, show punch time: Shows the actual time the employee clocked out If you have chosen one of the options such as rounding up, down, or to the nearest, you can set the number of minutes before moving on to Targets and types.   Targets and types -  Depending on the setup of your Planday account, you can choose between the following to limit the application of the custom rounding rule: Departments  - Apply the rule to specific Departments only. Employee groups  - Apply the rule only to specific Employee groups Employee types  - Apply the rule only to specific Employee types Press  Save  when done.   Encourage employees to leave comments when clocking in and out When employees clock in and out, they have the option to leave a comment. This comment is visible to the Schedule managers on the shift and during  Punch Clock approval . We recommend managers encourage their employees to leave comments when arriving early or late, as well as when clocking out before or after the shift ends.   The combination of Rounding settings and comments makes it faster to approve hours for payroll. In addition, managers can save themselves from following up on employees when they deviate from their scheduled hours by stating the reason.    What do the different flags mean? After adding some rounding rules, when you go to approve the clocked-in hours under  Schedule  >  Punch Clock  you can see two different flags:   üü® A yellow flag indicates that there is a difference between the time of the shift schedule and the stamp time. Note that the stamp time here reflects your set custom rules.   üü• A red flag indicates that the employee has not stamped out.   In the screenshot above, there are four Punch Clock entries: Planday User One:  The start time is affected by a  general rounding rule , which states that when an employee punches in before the start of the shift, the shift's scheduled time must be used. Thus no flag. They punch out later than the scheduled time hence a yellow flag on the End time. Planday User Two:  Punches in before the time of the shift schedule and here the same rule applies as for  User One , and therefore there is no flag. At the End time, there is a red flag indicating that a punch out is missing. Planday User Three : Punched in and out too late, and as no rounding rules apply here, the punch times are suggested as the Start and End times. Both the start and end times are marked with a yellow flag as the times differ from the scheduled hours in the shift. Planday User Four : The employee's shift schedule time and punch time are identical, so here there are no flags for either start or end time. The times in the Start and End fields can be edited here before  approving hours  for payroll. Example of a common rounding setup Here, we'll show you an example of a setup that is popular with many Planday customers. The basic idea is that when employees clock in or out within a few minutes of their scheduled time, Planday will suggest the scheduled shift time for approval. When the difference between the scheduled time and clocked time exceeds a set number of minutes, Planday will suggest the punched-in time for approval instead. Depending on comments or company policy, the manager can always edit what times to include for payroll.   Scenario When employees clock in or out within 5 minutes before or after the scheduled time, Planday will suggest the scheduled shift‚Äôs time instead of their clocked time. When employees clock in or out outside of 5 minutes before or after their scheduled shift, Planday will suggest the clocked time instead. Start and End times will be flagged for review. Setup Go to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced . Check that the dropdowns for Start and End are set to  No rounding, show punch time  under  Common rules .  These are the fallback settings for cases outside the rules you are going to set up under  Custom rules .  Next, press the  Create  button under  Custom rules .    The first rule is for when the employees  clock in before their shift starts: Give the rule a name Select  Punched in early Set the Rounding method to  No rounding, show shift time Max deviation duration decides for how many minutes before a shift‚Äôs start the Punch Clock entry will be rounded up to the scheduled start time. In this case,  5  minutes. Scroll down to make changes to Targets and types if needed. Press  Save The next rule is for when the employees  clock in late after their shift starts : Press Create and give the rule a name Select  Punched in late Set the Rounding method to  No rounding, show shift time Max deviation duration decides for how many minutes after a shift's start time the Punch Clock entry will be rounded down to the scheduled start time. In this case,  5  minutes. Scroll down to make changes to Targets and types if needed Click  Save The third rule is for when employees  clock out early before their shift ends : Click Create and give the rule a name Select  Punched out early Set the Rounding method to  No rounding, show shift time Max deviation duration decides for how many minutes before a shift ends the Punch Clock entry will be rounded up to the scheduled end time. In this case, 5 minutes. Scroll down to make changes to Targets and types if needed Click  Save Lastly, a rule for when employees  clock out after their shift ends : Click Create and give the rule a name Select  Punched out late Set the Rounding method to  No rounding, show shift time Max deviation duration decides for how many minutes after a shift ends the Punch Clock entry will be rounded down to the scheduled end time. In this case, 5 minutes. Scroll down to make changes to Targets and types if needed Click  Save üí° Changing the number of minutes a rule is applied is an effective way to make further adjustments. If employees are usually paid from the start time of their shift, then it makes sense to increase the number of minutes under Max deviation duration for when employees clock in early.

Act on employee comments from the Punch Clock. Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ This article is for beginner admins.  Here's a quick guide on  setting up Punch Clock  if you haven‚Äôt configured it already. The  Punch Clock  feature helps you stay in control of work attendance. You can use it to compare scheduled shifts to worked shifts and map out what to improve in your schedule.     With Punch Clock enabled, you can approve timesheets for payroll directly in Planday. Punch Clock is available on the web platform, the stand-alone  Kiosk app , and the  Planday app . How to approve Punch Clock entries in Planday You can approve Punch Clock entries using the  Pending actions  widget on the front page or by going to  Schedule  >  Punch Clock .   The Punch Clock page allows you to review and approve entries (shifts) per week or day, see approved shifts, and get a daily or weekly overview of approved vs unapproved stats. On the  Approve per week  (or  per day ) page, you will find all the clocked entries or shifts needing approval by a  Schedule manager or Admin .   Shift time  - This is the originally scheduled shift time. Punch time  - This is the actual punch-in and punch-out time. Start  &  End : These are times to be approved for payroll. This will differ from the punch-in/out times if you use  rounding rules . If there is no punch-out time, in case an employee forgets to punch out, this will be indicated by a red flag. You can manually enter a time in the End box and approve the Punch Clock entry. Adding an  End  time for a Punch Clock entry will also end the shift the employee forgot to punch out of. This is particularly useful if the Punch Clock is set up to use geofencing and the employee is no longer at the right location (which prevents them from using Punch Clock).   ‚ö†Ô∏è If there is no punch in or out time, there will be no punch clock entry. In this case it is not possible to manually create an entry, but instead, you should adjust and  approve the shift from the  Schedule .    Lastly, If these fields cannot be edited, it is because  deviation rules  are in place and you must decide if you want to use them to account for overtime or undertime.   Length  - This indicates the total length of the shift.   A single shift cannot be longer than 24 hours; if this happens, you must split the   shift before approving. Break  - This box is selected by default if you use automatic  breaks .   You should untick this box if an employee did not take a break. Comment  - You can see any remarks about the shift from the employee, upon punching in or out. Encourage your employees to leave a comment if they deviate from the scheduled shift. Selection box  - With the selection boxes you can pick which entries should be approved. Press the box on the top to bulk-select all entries for approval.  Alternatively, you can select individual entries for approval by checking the box in front of individual punch times. Once you have made the necessary corrections, press  Approve selected  to finalise the selected entries. Similarly, when an entry needs to be removed, select it from the list and press  Delete selected . Once these shifts are approved, they are ready for payroll. Approved shifts and Punch Clock entries can be found under the  Approved  tab,  Overview per day  or  Overview per week . üí° Please note that if you use an ePOS integration, such as  Tevalis , the Punch Clock data will only appear in Planday once the user has clocked both in and out for their shift. How to approve Punch Clock entries using the Planday app As a  Schedule Manager or Admin , you can adminster the clocked shifts from the  Planday app . Besides being able to punch in or out yourself from a scheduled shift, you can supervise and approve your employees' Punch Clock entries. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Please note that approving of Punch Clock entries on the Planday app is available for all Planday organisations except those using  Deviation rules . As you open the Planday app, whenever a new entry needs your attention, it will immediately appear in your  Requests  widget, under  Punch Clock entries  and also under  More  >  Requests > Punch Clock entries .   Tap on the  Punch Clock entries  to view the entries pending your approval. You will have a quick rundown of each entry and the option to  Approve  on the spot. You'll get a confirmation and the entry will disappear from the list.   The list will contain Punch Clock entries for  completed  and  ongoing Shifts , so you can add an end time and approve an employee's shift if they didn't punch out themselves. üí°  Unlike on the web, the mobile app does not support adding payroll supplements manually or splitting shifts longer than 24 hours for Punch Clock entries. For either of those, please use the web component of Punch Clock. Also, please note that the list of pending entries will only show entries from the last seven days. Log in to Planday on the web to see all the previous entries.   Need more help?   Please search for answers in the üîç  Help Center  or watch our ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  video tutorials .

If you have annual billing and need to report a user count increase, please email: Unexpected costs are appearing on my bill. What is the reason for this? Users fee  - Note that users are charged in increments of 5. For more information,  see the notes above . Additional users  - This cost item refers to users from the previous billing period that will be back billed. For example, in your March invoice, you had been charged for 20 users. On 15 March, you added 10 more (active) employees. Therefore, in the invoice for April, you will be retroactively charged for these 10 users from 15 - 31 March. You will also be charged for 30 users from the April invoice.  Note:  If you deactivate employees in a billing period that has already been billed, the billing will not change retroactively. The number of active employees at the beginning of the billing period will be charged for the next bill - regardless of the number of active employees in the previous billing period. SMS charges  - If you use SMS functions (e.g. sending reminders or notifications), the SMS rates of Planday's mobile service provider apply according to your contract. The cost as of 05/23 is ‚Ç¨0.08 plus VAT per SMS. If you have questions about this, feel free to email: If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact us by email at: Please remember to include your invoice or customer number contacting us via email.   How can I change the address on my Planday invoices? Please include your company name, customer number, and the desired new billing address in the email and send it to: How can I change the name of my company on the invoices? Please include your company name, customer number, and the desired new changes in the email and send it to: If the VAT or commercial register numbers have changed, outgoing and incoming parties must sign a  Novation Agreement . For this, Planday needs the following details from both parties: Name of the company Trade register number / VAT. ID number Registered company address Full name and contact e-mail address of the owner or authorised signatory. Please also provide the new billing e-mail address.   Once all information is submitted, Planday will create a  Novation Agreement  and forward it to all parties to sign electronically. The changes will be implemented after the signature. üí°  Novation is a replacement of a contract's party or obligation with a new one. The new party takes on the obligation of the original party and is completely releasing the former party of that obligation. The novation agreement must be signed by the transferor, the transferee, and the counterparty (the other contracting party). What happens if I have not paid an invoice? In this case, we will send you payment reminders to the e-mail address registered with your account. You will receive these reminders approximately 8 and 16 days after the invoice due date.   After the second reminder is sent to you, administrators will see an alert in Planday informing them that there are outstanding payments and a due date before a payment must be made before your Planday account will be blocked.   What can I do if my Planday account has been blocked? In this case, please contact the support team by emailing them at:  They will be able to explain the reason for the block, let you know which invoices are awaiting payment, and what steps are necessary to remove the block.

Employee groups  allow you to define the roles of your staff in Planday, while  Positions and Sections  will enable you to distinguish between subsets of these groups and where they should work in your schedule. With  Skills  you can define the skillset, expertise or special abilities needed for specific Shifts and limit those Shifts only to employees with those skills.   As an example, you can use Skills for certifications. If your work requires employees to have different courses or certifications, they can be assigned Skills to clarify their responsibilities. üí° Note that on a Shift with a skill assigned, only employees with that competency can work on that shift.  How to set up Skills To create one or more Skills, go to  Settings  >  People  >  Skills  >  Create .   Assign/Add a  name  to the Skill.   You can choose to make the Skills  Time-limited . This can be useful if your employees obtain certifications that expire on a specific date. The dates are added individually for each Employee, and the same Skill can be re-assigned to another employee.   You can choose whether seniority can be specified when a skill is assigned to an employee by selecting the option  Show seniority .   Choose to which  Employee groups  the Skill relates to. You can create and choose a category for these skills if you use many. Write a description if necessary to help you remember the Skill and its criteria. Remember to press  Save .

If you have set up  Contract rules  and assigned them to your employees, you can see how the conditions are met in the  Contracted hours overview . Based on this, you can make scheduling and overtime compensation decisions.    Contracted hours overview To do this, navigate to  Schedule  >  Contracted hours  and select a  Contract rule .   For the selected  Contract rule , set the  Contract period  and the  Departments  you want to view to narrow down your overview. If employees have worked Shifts in multiple Departments, those hours will also be included in the overview.   You will then see a list of employees to whom this selection applies. The columns show the following values: Scheduled hours  - working hours from the shifts planned, excluding unpaid breaks. Approved hours  - past shifts, approved for payroll. Contracted hours  - the number of working hours required and specified by the contract rules within the primary interval. Deviation in hours  - A positive balance (üî¥ red) indicates that the employee exceeded their required contracted hours. This can be transferred to their Overtime/Time off in lieu (TOIL) account. A negative balance (üü° yellow) indicates that the employee has not met the required hours yet. This can be deducted from their TOIL account. üü¢ Green indicates balanced hours. Hours to transfer  - the number of hours eligible to be transferred to an employee's Overtime account balance. This considers previously transferred hours and recent changes triggered by Approved hours. Transferred hours  - the number of hours previously transferred within the selected period. Overtime account balance  - This is the current balance of an employee's extra hours or needed hours. The balance is displayed as an overall total, not restricted by the selected period. üí° Please note that the number of working hours considered is also determined by the Shift types selected for the respective contract condition. Currently, the start date of a contract rule and the hired date of an employee are not linked to the calculation of working hours according to the contract. Transfer hours to overtime accounts Assuming you have set up  Overtime accounts for employees , and credit is available in the  Hours to transfer  column, you can transfer this to the overtime account. Both a positive and a negative balance can be transferred. To do this, tick the checkbox next to the employee's name and click on the  Transfer hours  arrow at the bottom.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For managers who wish to register employee preferences for work.  Are you contractually obliged with work timings? Use  Contracted availability   or  Working time rules  instead. What is availability? Availability allows you, the schedule manager, to record employees' wishes for work. Giving your employees shifts according to their wishes keeps them happy and can reduce the number of shift swaps and no-shows. Reduce managerial stress related to building a schedule and make a plan that will work for your business and your employees. This is how Availability works: Employees register their  availability from the Planday app  or  web . Employees' Availability is shown on the Schedule when looking to assign shifts:  green  for available,  red  for unavailable. Managers use the information to build schedules that accommodate the employees in the best way possible. As a manager, you can still schedule employees on unavailable marked days, but having availability data filled out provides practical knowledge by cutting down on back-and-forth communication. Using availability preferences when scheduling When you create a shift and employees have registered their Availability, you'll see their status when you're working on the schedule. As a manager, you decide to adjust the Schedule to your employees' Availability, and sometimes you might find yourself in situations where it isn't possible to accommodate their wishes. Available employees show with a green thumbs-up next to their names. Employees who have set themselves as Unavailable will be marked with a red thumbs down. If the employees have added a comment or reason with their wish, that will also show up when scheduling.   Customising options and intervals for Availability You can customise the availability function if it does not capture the necessary information for your needs.    Start by going to  Settings > Schedule > Swap & Availability > Availability.  Here you can set Availability by: Can/cannot work  (default) Intervals -  You can set up custom intervals employees can choose from, for example, Night shifts, Day shifts etc. Select start and end time -  This option will let your employees select a start and end time for when they're available or unavailable for each day. Set custom Availability settings In this example, the employer wants to capture further information from the employees, such as their availability to work night shifts. This can be configured by selecting  Intervals  under Available options from the Swap and Availability settings page. Employees will then be prompted to select from these options when they mark their availability:   How can employees register their Availability wishes Employees can mark their availability via the Planday app or by logging in from the web.  To set Availability via the Planday app , employees can navigate to  More  >  Availability  > press  Edit  > select the days you wish to mark > Mark your availability by pressing  Available  or  Unavailable  > press  Done . To set your Availability via Planday for desktop , navigate to  Home  >  Your   Availability  > press  Edit all  > select the days you wish to mark > Mark your availability by selecting  Can work  or  Cannot work.

This feature is included from the Pro Plan and up. Reach out to our support team if you'd like to try it out. After you've set up and used the  Auto-schedule  feature, you might find that some default settings are not optimal for you. If that is the case you can use the Auto-schedule advanced settings to make this feature save you time, with a few tweaks to fit your organization.    Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Auto-schedule.   There, you'll find settings for: Auto-schedule results : this gives you the option to find better solutions for allocating shifts. So the longer it runs, the more likely it is to find a solution that fits all the requirements. Employee availability : allows you to decide how to account for your employees'  Availability  preferences . Scheduling approach : where you can choose between a rotating or fixed approach. including  breaks  or  employees with no  contracted hour requirements  set  into the Auto-schedule analysis. üí°  If you would like to use these options and cannot find them in your Settings menu, please reach out to our support team to have them enabled for your schedule and organisation. Auto-schedule results This option allows you to choose whether the calculations should stop at the first suitable solution (after a few seconds) or continue until the optimal solution is found (could take more than 90 seconds).    That way, you can get the following: acceptable results, after an estimated short processing time; good results, after a medium amount of time used for processing; optimal results, taking the time to take the best-fit approach, and considering all the factors included in the analysis. You can read more about what Auto-schedule takes into account when drafting a schedule, in the setup guide, available  here . üí°  You can tweak this option at any time and you can always run the analysis again if the resulting schedule doesn't fit with your scheduling needs or preferences.   Employee availability The availability preferences of your employees can also be considered when automatically assigning shifts. The availability settings only work for normal availability, not  contracted availability . 1. When  availability is prioritized and shifts are prevented in time slots marked as unavailable , the analysis will try to find a solution that will: prioritize assigning shifts in the Available time slots will not assign shifts in the time slots marked as Unavailable and fill in the rest of the Schedule with the necessary time slots, even if the is no preference marking for them (if needed).  2. When  availability is prioritized and unavailable slots are considered , the analysis will try to find a solution that will: prioritize assigning shifts in the Available time slots will try to avoid assigning shifts in the time slots marked as Unavailable, if possible, fill in the rest of the Schedule with the necessary time slots, even if the is no preference marking for them (if needed). 3. When  Shifts are assigned only in Available time slots , the analysis will present a solution that will: only assign shifts in the Available time slots. This means that the Schedule draft might not comply with all the other requirements and might need more input from you. Scheduling approach The Schedule draft will prioritize assigning as many shifts as possible over following a certain approach, but it will respect your selected guideline when possible. No restrictions - assign employees to shifts based on best current fit The system will determine whether an employee is eligible to take the shift (skills, is part of the employee group, is not on holiday, is available to work, etc.) Alternating rotation - prioritize variation for an employee‚Äôs positions/employee groups, when assigning shifts This setting will try to rotate employees between the different positions and employee groups they are allowed to work in, during the period that is being scheduled. The rotation is viewed as an average over the period, not from shift to shift. Fixed - prioritize an employee‚Äôs experience when assigning shifts This means that within the period being scheduled, the auto-scheduling tool will try to make sure an employee is allocated shifts with the same employee group they‚Äôve been scheduled for. So if they are in groups A and B, but have mostly been scheduled in A, it will make sure that in the period selected they will get shifts mostly in employee group A, but not an even split of A and B.    Employees with no fixed hous & breaks  No fixed working hours requirement (1) : if none of your employees has a set contracted hours requirement, you should  include employees with no fixed working hours requirement  if you want them to be assigned Shifts in the Auto-schedule draft. üí°   Please keep in mind that the Schedule draft will be better suited for your organization if contracted hours are specified, where possible.   Breaks (2) : when creating your schedule draft, the Auto-schedule feature will try to fit your requirements for working hours by: comparing the working hours‚Äô requirements against  paid hours  (or payroll-approved hours), if you choose to  Include breaks in the total working hours comparing the working hours‚Äô requirements against  all hours  ( scheduled and payroll-approved hours, which might also include breaks), if you choose  NOT  to  Include breaks in the total working hours.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins. Learn about  Creating and editing shifts here  or familiarise yourself with  Scheduling on Planday . Are you an employee?  See  How to swap, hand over and sell shifts via the Planday app  or learn  How to apply for open shifts from the app . What is an Open shift? On Planday, it is possible to create shifts without assigning them to specific employees. These types of shifts are called  Open shifts .  Open shifts can be helpful if you want to plan a Shift where employees can request work based on their role, skill set and preference. How to create Open shifts? To create an Open shift, proceed like you would when creating a Normal shift, but do not assign it to an employee.   In the  Employee view , create an  Open shift  in the top row of the Schedule. If you create the Shift in an employee's row, you can select Open shift as the first option from the employee drop-down list. The Open shift will be the default selection when creating a Shift in the  Groups or Positions view . Once an Open shift has been created, it appears highlighted in red üî¥ on the Schedule. Only employees assigned to the corresponding Employee group can request the Open shifts created for those roles. The Shift remains open and un-assigned until an  admin or a Schedule manager  approves the request.   Swaps, Hand over and Sell shifts Employees can  Swap, Hand over or Sell  their shifts amongst colleagues within the same Employee group and Department. Shifts remain assigned to an employee until a colleague and manager confirm the action. Swap  - allows an employee to exchange their Shift with another colleague and take one of theirs with mutual agreement. Hand over (transfer)  - enables an employee to give away a shift directly to a colleague with mutual agreement. Sell  - allows employees to request their colleagues to take over their shift. Shifts marked for sale appear as Open shifts to colleagues. üí° Before the request reaches you, the action must be confirmed by the colleague (for swap or handover), or the on-sale shift must be requested (for handover).   Optional notification settings By default, Planday will notify you of each request so no action can be taken without your consent.    If you want to set up how staff can swap or book shifts specifically, or if and when your confirmation is required, navigate to  Settings  >  Schedule  section >  Swap Settings . ‚ö†Ô∏è  It is advised to exercise caution and careful consideration when making alterations in this area. üí° To ensure that a manager always approves open shift requests, swaps, or handovers, put a high number, like 50000, in the three fields highlighted above. If no manager approval is needed, simply put 0 in these fields. How to process shift approval requests To do this, navigate to the  Pending Requests  section from  Schedule  >  Pending   Requests .   You can also get there directly from the  Pending actions  widget if it is added to your Planday dashboard.   You can switch between the  Swap requests  (Swaps and Handovers) and  Shift requests  (Open Shifts Requests) sections. You can filter by departments via the drop-down list to narrow it down further if needed.   Swap Requests  - Click the pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è ( Edit)  on the right of the action's row. In the edit window, you can optionally assign a Shift type to the Shift in question and  Approve  or  Reject  it. Shift requests  - In the Assigned Employee column, click  Assign Employee . You will then see the employees who have applied to take over the Shift. If there is more than one, select one by clicking their name and confirm with  Assign . Approving shift requests via the Planday app Pending actions can also be handled in the  Planday app . You can see them under the  Requests  widget. In the example screenshots, a Shift swap is approved: To do this, tap on  Swap and handovers , select the request and tap on  Confirm  or  Reject .   Enable or disable notifications based on Shift requests Under  Settings  >  Your organisation  >  Notifications,  you can set who should be notified in case of  Swap approvals  (and handovers) or  Shift requests  (Open Shift request).

DST adjustments for the summer to the winter seasons can occur at different dates around the year across the globe. This year, the changes will occur on the following days: EU countries & the UK US & Canada Australia & New Zealand 29 October 2023 5 November 2023 2 April 2023 The time adjustment usually occurs on the last Sunday of October. The time adjustment usually happens on the first Sunday of November. The time adjustment usually occurs on the first Sunday of April. For other regions, you can find more information on  TimeAndDate.com     When the  DST period ends , the clocks are  set back one hour  during the colder months. Practically, this means that on the date when the DST period ends, the clock will instantly go back by one hour (for instance, when the clock strikes 02:00 am, it would immediately become 01:00 am instead. So, on this date, the hour between 01:00 and 01:59:59  occurs twice  in any given time zone). üí° Please note that the exact time for the clock adjustment depends on the time zone of your country, and it can be different from the example given above. This change usually happens during the night to minimise work schedule disruptions.   What does this mean for you, and how to make adjustments in Planday The DST practice can have different implications for managing your organisation in Planday. It depends on your policies and the country where you conduct your operations. The following fixes only apply if you have night shift employees working at a time that crosses over a DST change. ‚ö†Ô∏è   Planday does not support automatic DST adjustments . If you need to switch from DST, you must check and manually correct the affected shifts on the  Schedule  by  increasing  the shift duration or adjusting the  Punch Clock entries  by adding an hour. Check and  edit the shift duration  for the shifts that overlap with the DST. As the clock changes backwards (and one hour will  occur twice ), you should ensure that the shift duration remains correct.    For example, if a shift starts at 10:00 pm and ends at 04:00 am, it should account for six payable hours. But, if it's scheduled on a DST end date and we gain an hour, you'll need to  manually increase this shift  until 05:00 am, or adjust the Punch Clock entry, so that it accounts for seven hours instead of six.     Check your payroll data  to ensure no discrepancy or miscalculation in the number of hours worked for the date when daylight saving time changes occurred. If your payroll data depends on approved shifts and, by extension, on the duration of those shifts, making sure that the shift duration is correct should also be enough to correct your payroll data.   Remember to also communicate any changes to your employees to ensure that everyone is on the same page and avoids confusion. Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For Admins, Schedule Managers and Employees using Planday.  Check the status of Planday here  status.planday.com  and subscribe to updates. Occasionally, Planday and its related services undergo  maintenance . This means that, during the maintenance period, those  services are unavailable . Depending on what the maintenance implies, you might not be able to access Punch Clock, use the web client of Planday, or log into to Planday app or Kiosk app.   The maintenance window is usually scheduled  outside of regular working hours.  However, if your organization has flexible or prolonged working hours, there might be scenarios in which your schedule will overlap with the planned downtime.  For example, some of your employees might punch out of the night shift while their colleagues start the early service.   Ideally, your schedule would be unaffected, but if your employees need to punch in or out using Punch Clock during this time, please follow the recommendations below to ensure that the correct start and end times are recorded.    We are very sorry about any inconvenience a scheduled maintenance window might cause. We need to perform regular maintenance operations to make system health checks and improve the stability and availability of Planday.   Thank you for your patience!   Recommended actions 1. Inform your employees about the upcoming maintenance You can send a  message through Planday , create a post in the  newsfeed , or communicate it using other preferred platforms.  üí° Please ensure that those with shifts during the maintenance window are informed about the downtime timeframe and what to do if their shifts start/end before or during downtime.   2. What to do when Punch Clock is unavailable If you have staff members who are scheduled to punch in or out during the maintenance window: Inform your staff that they won‚Äôt be able to use Punch Clock as they normally would during the timeframe. Put a system in place to register the affected shifts' start and end times. You can ask your staff to use the  comments  section when punching in later to add their punch-in/out times after the maintenance is complete.  Remember to register those times in Planday and  approve them as usual .  3. Approving Punch Clock entries after maintenance For employees who punched in before the maintenance window but did not have access Punch Clock during the maintenance: After the maintenance is complete, enter the shift end time under  Schedule  >  Punch Clock > To approve per week  (or  per day )   and approve the shifts, as usual.    In the overview list, the shifts without a start or end time will be marked with a red flag ( 3 ), next to the missing fields. If your employees choose to leave a comment on their shift, this will also be shown in the Comment ( 6 ) column.  This is similar to when an employee forgets to punch out at the end of their shift. Read more about  How to approve Punch Clock entries .     For employees with no Punch Clock entries on the day: Collect their start and end times. Go to  Schedule , find the shift, click on it and  edit both the start and end times  on the  Edit shift  view if needed.    You can approve the shift from the same view by using the  Approve  toggle on the right side or by selecting the Shift from the Schedule.

See  how to deactivate or reactivate an employee . Deactivate employees What happens to an employee‚Äôs data when their account is deactivated?   Some data are kept while others are deleted or deactivated. The data that are kept include: the employee‚Äôs worked hours the history of their leave requests and their leave and TOIL balances the documents attached to their profile, such as contracts, personal documents, etc. the details attached to their profile, such as hourly wage, salary, contracted hours What is made inactive is the following: the employee‚Äôs access to Planday their leave account and TOIL account the employee is not part of a department anymore their username You can‚Äôt book leave nor approve or deny pending leave requests on an inactive account. Before you deactivate an employee, make sure you: approve or deny their  pending leave requests approve or delete in the schedule the  shifts related to the employee‚Äôs TOIL account How long is the data of a deactivated employee kept in Planday?   All data is kept for a standard period of  5 years  but as admin, you can change this period by going to  Settings  >  People  >  General  >  Delete deactivated employees . Then, you can choose the number of months after when a deactivated employee should be permanently deleted.   When an employee account is permanently deleted the account cannot be recreated and therefore we recommend that you only take this action when necessary and cautiously, as an employee will lose all payroll and HR history. When an employee is deactivated with immediate effect, when will their access to Planday stop? They will have access to Planday until the end of the day they were deactivated. If the  deactivation  date is  in the past , the employee will lose access immediately, both on the web and on the app.  Web: The user is prompted with an error message indicating that their username or password is incorrect. App: The user is prompted with an error message indicating that it failed to connect to the server. Can I deactivate an employee and set a future date?   Yes, you can. In that case, there will be an orange banner displaying the date when the employee will be deactivated.  It will only be visible to the users who can edit the employee‚Äôs profile.   If a future date is set, the employee will have access to the system until this date and will be deactivated the following day. I‚Äôve deactivated an employee and I must pay their remaining holiday balance. How do I do that? You can export a leave account report. To do this, follow these steps: Go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence accounts) Set the dates in the period filter from the start of the accruing period to the day the employee is deactivated Click on  Filters  and choose the holiday account Click on  Export The final column  Leave pay - at the end day of the period filter  in the export will give you the amount to pay.  It‚Äôs advised to delete their future holiday in order to get an accurate figure of the accrued leave that they are owed in their final pay. To do so, go to  Schedule  >  Absence requests  (or  Leave requests ) > Adjust the period filter > Choose the statuses  Approved  and  Pending  > Find the leave requests > Edit them and click on  Deny . Can payroll still be processed for the deactivated employees? Yes, you can still process payroll for them. To do this, go to  Payroll  >  Payroll export  >  Custom selection of employees  >  Select employees  > click on  Deactivated employees .   If you can‚Äôt see the name of a deactivated employee, reach out to our Support team who will help you. Where can I see who deactivated an employee? You can find the deactivation history of the deactivated employee in the employee‚Äôs profile. Go to  People  >  Misc  >  Deactivated  > find the employee and click Edit. Click on  Show deactivation history  on the red banner, as shown in the picture below. ‚¨áÔ∏è   Why do I have a spaceman when I try to deactivate an employee? It can be because of the following reasons: the employee is not part of any department. Add the employee to a department by  clicking on their name  and on the  +Add  button under  Department the birthday date is set to an invalid year like 2984. To fix this, change the birthday date from the Planday app Why can‚Äôt I see the deactivated employees? This is usually because you are restricted to one or several departments. When employees are deactivated, they lose their connection to a department. You can reach out to support and they‚Äôll help you with this request.   Reactivate employees I reactivated an employee but I can‚Äôt book a holiday on their leave account. Why? When the employee was deactivated, their leave account was made inactive. Reactivating the employee doesn‚Äôt reactivate their leave account.  Reach out to our Support team who can help you with this or  assign a new Leave account  to the employee.  How do I reactivate an employee‚Äôs TOIL account? After an employee has been deactivated, their TOIL account is made inactive and can‚Äôt be reactivated if the employee is reactivated. If you want to have this account reactivated, you would need to reach out to our Support team. Otherwise, you can keep the old TOIL account and you can create a new one.  Here is how to do it: Go to  Schedule  >  Absence accounts  (or Leave accounts) >  Time off in lieu accounts  > Select the  Inactive  account status Set an expiry date for the old TOIL account Go to  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  > Edit the TOIL account template Set a  Reset day  on the TOIL account template. Make sure the option  Renew automatically  is not ticked Assign the new TOIL account and set the start date to be the date after the expiry date you previously set and remove the end date on the new account Go back to the TOIL account template and remove the  Reset day Where can I see who reactivated an employee? You can go to People > Employees > Edit the relevant employee > Click on  User actions  >  Deactivation history .   I reactivated an employee but they still can‚Äôt log into Planday. What do I do? You would need to check if their username is correct. Edit the employee‚Äôs profile and check their username (email) in the top left corner. If the email is incorrect follow the steps in  Update an employee‚Äôs username (email) as a manager . Send a reset password link so the employee can reset their password.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins.  Read an  introduction to Planday's structure  or learn  how to create Employee groups . How to delete Employee groups You need to consider some essential points before deleting an  Employee group . Employee groups define your Schedules, so deleting an Employee group will impact existing schedules.   Review the following points to prevent any negative impact when deleting an Employee group: Previously created shifts connected to the deleted Employee group will remain visible and will still affect payroll. New shifts cannot be created using the deleted Employee group. Assigned shifts for the deleted Employee group can no longer be swapped. Open shifts for the deleted Employee group cannot be requested or claimed. Assigning employees to different Employee groups after you delete the Employee group can impact payroll if there are inconsistencies between the defined wages of the Employee groups or duplication of shifts. In most cases, we encourage you to reassign shifts and/or create new Employee groups before deleting the Employee group to ensure that your schedule remains dynamic. If you are satisfied that it is safe to delete the Employee group, you can follow these steps: Go to  People  >  Employee Groups . Find the Employee group you want to delete and press the  Edit  icon on the right. From the  Edit employee group  view, press  Delete  and confirm your decision.   Furthermore, if there are any Positions associated with the Employee group in your schedule, you will not be able to delete the Employee group. In this case, you will need to delete the Shifts for that position, delete the Position and then delete the Employee group.   How to restore Employee groups If you have deleted an Employee group but need to recover it, you can do so easily.  Navigate to  People  >  Employee groups  and find the  Restore Employee group  button in the top right corner. This will prompt a new window where you can select which Employee group you'd like to reinstate and whether or not employee memberships should be kept as they were before the deletion.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For administrators with legacy Planday accounts. Most legacy Planday accounts have only male and female options when choosing gender in the  employee setup form . By default, this is a required field that you, as an admin, must fill out, and your employee can choose.   Through consensus, we have reached a solution that gives you and your employees control while keeping the current setup for clients who need this field mandatory. Here is how you can change it for your Planday setup with a few easy steps.   How to archive the current gender field Start by going to your Employee field setup form via  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup . Press the  Archive field  button on the row of the existing Gender field.   Once archived, the field will be moved to the  Archived fields  section at the bottom of the employee form, and the legacy choice is no longer visible on the employee create or edit form nor on the employee profile settings. How to create custom gender field options Under the  Misc section , press the  Add field  link and set Type to  dropdown . As an admin, this allows you to add a custom selection of gender choices for the employees to pick from. Alternatively, you can set the Type to  text , allowing employees to write how they wish to identify.   Under  Access levels , set the permissions to allow you and the employee to edit this field when creating or editing their profile.  You can also set if this is a required field to fill or optional.   Depending on what you set up, the employee can now go into their profile via the web or Planday app and identify their choice of gender.   FAQ's Can I add additional genders to the existing gender field instead of archiving it? No. If you want your employee form to support additional gender options, you can create a custom field as a dropdown with a defined set of options. Or you can add a text option to let your employees write how they wish to identify. If you add a custom gender selection in your employee form, archive the legacy gender field and replace it with your custom field. Are any integrations affected by removing the gender field? Some legacy payroll integrations may require mapping employees to a fixed gender field. Please check the syncing requirements of your integration if you work with a service that requires a gender field to be present when sending employee data. This will help ensure that the necessary data is transmitted correctly and that all relevant fields are included in the integration process. Can the newly created gender field be put back in the Information section? When you archive the old gender field, a new custom field can only be created in a section such as Miscellaneous or Payroll.  Need more help?

This feature is included in the Plus plan and up.     What is the Supervisor feature? The Supervisor feature allows you to set up notifications for leave requests, HR-related or shift requests that go to the supervisor of an individual employee rather than to all managers in a department.    It also allows you to add   extra filtering on Leave requests (or Absence requests) and Punch Clock entry approvals of the employees you supervise.     Choose the supervisors and assign a supervisor to an employee Once this feature is enabled on your Planday, you can see two new fields in the  employee form setup : Supervisor Is Supervisor Go to  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form set-up , find both fields and configure the visibility and settings of your two new fields by clicking on the edit icon.   Make sure that the following settings are enabled for both fields.‚¨áÔ∏è   Then, if you go to the employees‚Äô form you can select which employees are supervisors, or who is their supervisor. To do this, follow these steps: Head to  People  >  Employee  >  Edit employee  >  Personal details  tab (1).

Set up notifications for supervisors As soon as at least one employee is selected as supervisor, you‚Äôll find a new option in  Settings (1)  >  Your organisation  >  Notifications (2) :  Supervisor for the individual employee (3).  Select this option so that supervisors receive notifications for leave requests, etc.  üí° You can send the notification as a message or SMS (if you choose the last option, please be aware that SMS charges may apply).   Use the supervisor filter Use this filter to narrow down the holiday requests and the Punch Clock entries for specific supervisors to act upon.   For example, you‚Äôre a supervisor for 5 employees in your department. If you only want to see the Punch Clock entries of the employees you supervise, go to  Schedule  >  Punch Clock  (1.) > select your name in the supervisor filter (2.).   Likewise, if you only want to see the Leave requests of the employees you supervise, go to  Schedule >  Leave requests  (1.) > click on the  Filters  (2.) button and select your name in the list of supervisors (3.).     How to disable the Supervisor feature The supervisor option cannot be disabled after being activated, however, you can archive both supervisor fields directly in the employee form setup if you no longer want to use it. To archive the fields, go to  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form set-up , then click on  Archive field  buttons on the rows of the Supervisor fields.       Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For advanced admins. Learn more about  creating or applying Contract rules here . Change in contract conditions An employee's working hours may change, such as going from full-time to part-time hours per week contract. You can adjust the contract rules accordingly to help you schedule their shifts.   Option 1  ‚Äì  New Contract rule If you have time before the change date,  create a new contract rule  with a start date on the change date. Then, on the change date,  assign this new contract rule  to the employee in their profile.   Example:  On 15 September, an employee's weekly working hours change from 40 to 20 hours starting on 1 October. Create a new '20-hour week' contract rule with a start date of 1 October. Then, on 1 October, assign this new contract rule to the employee in their profile.  Option 2  ‚Äì  Switch to an existing Contract rule You can assign one of your existing Contract rules to the employee. Note: In this case, the start date of this contract term is in the past. Important : Any change to Contract rules  also has a retroactive effect , depending on how far in the past the start date of the other contract rule is applied. If you accumulate  overtime based on contracted hours , this can lead to problems. Therefore,  before  you make the change, do the following: Transfer all hours accumulated in the past  Hours to transfer  to the employee's overtime account. You can find out how to do this in the article  How to use Contracted hours for schedule overview . If you cannot transfer all the hours, you can make minor adjustments manually (by editing the employee's profile > Time off in Lieu). Example : On 15 September, you find out that an employee's working hours will change from 40 to 20 hours per week starting on 1 October. You already have a ""20-hour week"" contract rule ready, but its start date is 1 January in the past. Before assigning the ""20-hour week"" contract to the employee in their profile, follow the steps described above. Changing the Contract rule start date of an interval üí°  It's best to set the start date to a Monday for weekly intervals or the 1st day of a month for monthly intervals. You might have situations when an interval start date aligns with a new employee's joining date. However, if this date falls in the middle of an interval, you may prefer the working hours to be calculated in a regular weekly interval - from Monday to Sunday. You can: either : Add a new weekly interval in the contract rule whose start date falls on a Monday. You can then select this as the primary interval. or : Change the start date of the Contract rule to a Monday. Important : Any change to Contract rules  also has a retroactive effect. This means that if you calculate your overtime based on your Contract rules, you will see some unwanted plus or minus hours when you change the start date of the interval.   In this case, you can manually adjust by editing the employee's profile under the Time off in lieu tab.   Example : An employee is assigned a ""40-hour week"" contract condition. They work five days a week (Mon-Fri), eight hours a day. The contract's weekly interval starts on a Wednesday, but you change it to the Monday before their first working day. This automatically transfers -8 hours for Monday and Tuesday, as they haven't worked on those days. To compensate, you can manually adjust overtime: Go to the employee's profile >  Time off in lieu  >  Create  >  Adjustment > select Monday as the date and enter 16 hours with a comment explaining the adjustment. Once saved, the hours will be balanced again.   Need more help?   Please search for answers in the üîç  Help Center  or watch our ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  video tutorials .

Only managers with access to deactivate other employees (with access level Admin or HR Managers) will be notified of deactivations.   Inactive employee account deletion Following the right to be forgotten, under certain circumstances, and only on request and approval from a Planday admin, the Planday support team can act on requests to delete employee accounts permanently.   To delete an employee account, that account must have been inactive for 5+ years at a minimum. This is because data in the Planday is used for HR and payroll regulatory reporting by employers.   If an account is inactive for less than 5+ years, an employee must first contact their admin to see whether data can be removed. If there is agreement from the Planday admin that data can be deleted, then the employee account may be permanently deleted and cannot be retrieved at all. Data related to the account may also be rendered irretrievable.   We recommend that you only take this action when necessary and cautiously, as an employee will lose all payroll and HR history.   As an employee, to request an account deletion, please get in touch with your organisation's Planday admin first and then contact Planday Support team.   Automatically delete deactivated employee accounts Depending on where your business operates, you may have a legal obligation as an employer to permanently delete information on former employees after their employment has ended.    This is also relevant for staying compliant with your employees‚Äô right to be forgotten, according to GDPR legislation.    To automatically delete deactivated users from your Planday account, go to  Settings > People > General > Delete deactivated Employees , to turn on the feature and set how many months after deactivation a user should be permanently deleted from your Planday account.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins and Schedule Managers. See a list of all  video tutorials on Wistia  or see  tutorials for employees here . This article will show you how to configure different parts of Planday by taking you through short guided video tutorials.   Getting Started How to log in to Planday from a web browser or the Planday app You need to have three pieces of information to log in to Planday. Planday URL:  This is the URL you will need to go to on the web version to log in to Planday.  Username:  This would be the  email address  you received the initial email invitation. Password:  The password you set up by clicking the confirmation sent in your email. You and everyone on your team will use these three items to log in on both the app and web versions of Planday.   How to create, edit or delete Departments Use  Departments  to separate different work areas and keep your schedules organized and efficient. Departments can also be different locations of your business or separate areas within your company, each with its schedule and employees.    How to create Employee groups In Planday, you can use  Employee groups  to describe a job, a role or a function (for example waiter, receptionist, cashier). Employee groups hold the pay rate for the employee and allow employees to work in multiple roles. They are also needed to create  Positions  on the schedule.   How to create, edit and invite employees Populating Planday with your employees is essential to getting your schedule up and running.  Create employees  by filling in their data. Assign new employees to one or more Departments and add them to Employee groups. Finally, invite your staff to Planday and give them access to the schedule.   How to schedule Assuming you have created Departments, created job roles in Employee groups, and invited a group of employees to Planday, it is time to bring it together. You can go to the  Schedule  page and  create shifts  for your employees.    Using Planday How to create and use Schedule templates Schedule templates  are the next stage of scheduling and allow you to plan and schedule weeks in advance. By creating a default schedule template, using a mixture of assigned and open shifts, you can create a flexible template that can be applied up to 14 times in one go. This will reduce your scheduling time and allow you to plan more effectively, giving you and your employees a clear view of who is working.   How to set up Open shifts Open shifts  in your schedule are shifts that are not yet assigned to a specific employee but are available to be requested by employees. You can set the start and end time, select the particular Employee group and position, define the kind of shift you know you need to fill, and leave it open. The shift will show as a placeholder on the schedule. Your employees can then request to take this available shift if they match the Department and Employee group required by the  Shift type .   How to troubleshoot logging in to Planday  ‚ö†Ô∏è One of the most common issues for logging in for new employees is that the email (username) is misspelt or incorrect. Follow the instructions in the article  Updating Usernames (email)  to correct it. Is Punch Clock asking for an  Activation code ? It may be that the device you are using to Punch in is not on the approved Wi-Fi address or your dynamic IP has changed. Ensure that your device is on the correct Wi-Fi network. Follow the instructions to  check and update your registered IP address . For employees:  What you can do if you have problems with the Punch Clock If you are having difficulties logging in, there's most likely an error with one of these details.   How to configure an employee form setup Each employee has a customizable profile that you can fill out or have the employee fill in. If you need to add more sections to hold more details than the standard fields, you can edit the setup form  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup  and add  additional fields .   How to assign hourly wages to Employees  On Planday, it is possible to set up the  hourly wage  of multiple employees (with the same rate and valid from the same date) at the same time from the Employee Groups page. Wages are set in the Employee group and thus attached to employees belonging to that group. This allows employees to belong to multiple groups but have different pay rates per group if necessary. Wages can also be assigned individually or set to apply from a specific date automatically by editing the Employee profile under the Employment tab.   How to set fixed salaries for your employees Salaries  differ from wages as they do not rely on shift data. A salary is a fixed amount based on a pay period paid monthly by default. You can choose the allocation method for the salary cost distribution across your schedule, giving you an estimate of what a fixed-salary person will cost you per day or hour.   How to communicate with staff via Planday messaging Within Planday, you can communicate with your staff directly through  messages  without relying on external social media groups or communication tools such as Whatsapp. You can send a message to a specific employee, an Employee group, an entire department, or across your organization. Employees will receive an in-app notification informing them they have a message waiting for them. You can share information through the Newsfeed and the Events tab to update your staff on general issues. You can also force an answer should you require a reply from your employees.   How to assign access levels and give employees additional roles By setting  Access levels  you can let some employees have additional access to Planday functions to perform managerial tasks. By default, there are three access levels in Planday:  Schedule Manager ,  People/HR Manager , and  Admin . An optional Account admin role gets assigned to an admin that signed up for Planday. The access areas for each access level can be seen in this  article .    How to set up the Punch Clock The Punch Clock allows you to bridge the gap between paying for the scheduled time and precise worked time. Punch Clock can be set up in a number of ways: For  clocking in from the web  on a PC or tablet with pre-defined IP addresses or Wi-Fi For punching in using the  Planday app within a specified geo-location For punching in from a physical location as a  standalone Kiosk app How to edit and approve Punch Clock entries Once you have started using Punch Clock, you must edit or  approve the Punch Clock entries  as they come. Approving worked times marks the corresponding shift as ready for payroll (green) and updates the schedule with the approved times for that shift. Once approved, the entries cannot be edited, and approved times are used for payroll.     Advance features How to configure automatic breaks Automatic breaks  take the trouble out of making deductions for break time. By creating a Break rule, you can set a pause interval to automatically appear on a shift that goes over a certain length on your schedule.   How to create and use Shift types The most common use for  Shift types  is recording sickness on the schedule and reporting this data for payroll reports. Shift types can also be used to change shift rates or add supplements. This is handy when paying different rates for evening or weekend shifts.   How to run reports on Shift types Once shifts on the schedule have a specific Shift type, you can go to  Reports > Shift type statistics  for a  report based on utilising these Shift types . For example, you could run a report to see the ratio between reported sickness and worked shifts.   How to set up Contracted availability Contracted availability  lets you see the hours you have obliged with an employee. This will let you see the specific contracted times or days an employee should be available for work. Having availability information will allow you to schedule the right people for the correct times matching their work availability. Contracted availability can be set up individually by editing an employee's account.   How to create a schedule using Positions and Sections  Positions and sections  allow you to plan your schedule when filling a shift with the right employee is more important than all employees having a shift. Scheduling in the Positions view provides flexibility, highlighting your schedule gaps by position instead of by staff.   How to configure revenue You can compare  Revenue  data against your Scheduled costs to highlight salary percentages or make other cost comparisons. Revenue can be added manually to the Planday by going to  Settings > Reports > Revenue . You can also set up forecasts and budgets to ensure you meet your goals and make changes to the schedule if you see things going over budget.   How to set up Contracts for electronic signatures You can send out  Contracts  or any documents your employees need to sign through Planday. Employees cannot add information to these Documents; they can only sign them. These files are saved on their profile and can be reviewed later. Signing contracts can be anything from employment terms, promotions in salary, work equipment loans, handing out keys or anything where you need an agreement from any employee.   How to set up Contract rules The  Contract rules  feature a scheduling tool that allows you to track the number of scheduled working hours for an employee. A red, orange, or green indicator appears around the employee's profile picture on the schedule to highlight potential scheduling issues. Contract rules can also be used for managing Flex/Overtime accounts.   How to generate a payroll report You can use the  Payroll export  function to quickly generate a payroll report in Excel, PDF or your preferred payroll integration system such as Sage 50, QuickBooks online and more. Approve existing worked hours and take action on pending leave requests before going for a pay run. See  what to prepare before creating a payroll report .   How to set up the Auto-schedule feature Auto-schedule  allows you to automate your scheduling to make it even easier to schedule more efficiently. You will need specific information in the system to ensure auto-scheduling runs effectively, such as Working time rules, Contracted availability, Contract rules, and at least 12 weeks' worth of previous scheduling data. üí° If you want to try this Pro/Enterprise-only feature, please contact our support team.

If you have questions about your vacation and overtime accounts, it's best to talk to your manager or employer since the policies can vary from company to company.

On the schedule page, you can see who you'll work with and find coworkers interested in shift swaps. If your employer has  Contract rules  enabled, you'll see an indicator on your picture in the schedule. Hover over it to see how your scheduled hours align with your contract.

You'll find details about your coworkers that your employer has shared. You can send them direct messages within Planday from this page.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents You can manage your employees from multiple places in Planday. You can create and edit employees from the  People  and the  Schedule  page. You can also create new employees using the Planday app as an admin.   Create employees from the People section on Planday web Go to  People  >  Employees  you will find the  Create employee  button in the top right corner.   You can add the relevant employee details for your new team member in the  Create employee form . Fields marked with a  *  are mandatory to fill out. The username must be a valid email address because this is where the login information will be sent. Learn more about  updating usernames  and the employee confirmation process. üí° Save time by pressing the dual column icon in the top right (next to the Save button) and switch to a more compact layout. Use of special characters in the username The following characters are not supported in the username: Umlauts √§, √∂ and √º, and the √ü in upper and lower case. Scandinavian letters √¶, √∏, √• in upper and lower case. These characters are supported in the username: a-z in upper and lower case, 0-9 and .! #$%&'*+/=? ^_`{|}~-   As the final step of creating an employee's account, you can decide to send a  welcome message  or  login  information to the employee or do this later.

Create employees from the People section on the Planday app Log in to the Planday app as an admin, go to  More  >  People  and then click the add employee   icon from the right corner. Fill out the employee details and press  Create employee  button to finish.     Bulk create employees üí°  This function is under development. If you need help, you will receive this in your onboarding, or you can send a message to the support team. If you have many employees to import into Planday, creating several staff members in bulk is a suitable alternative to  creating employees individually . To do this, go to  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Employee import via template .   The more extensively you have already set up Planday with Departments, Employee groups, Employee types & contract conditions, the more effective the bulk import will be.   You can press  Insert rows  to add multiple employees directly to Planday via this interface.   Alternatively, you can press  Download template  and fill in the provided Excel document with details of your employees. Once complete, you can upload this via the Import option. Select the template data format to view the format needed for Planday to read your employee data. Enter your employee data in the following format in your Excel file. The fields email address, name, gender and department are mandatory fields. Leave the structure of the template unchanged - do not delete or add any rows. If you want an employee to be assigned to a department, put an X in the corresponding field. If you want an employee to be assigned to an Employee group, enter a number for the hourly wage (e.g. ""12"" for 12.00 ‚Ç¨) or a 0 in the corresponding field. Bank account can be written as the registration number and the account number separated by a space or / For example 1234 567890 or 1234 / 567890 Dropdown : In the columns containing lists, the value you enter must match an element value found in the list. For example, in the gender column, you can enter Male or Female. Check box : If a tick box needs to be ticked, enter either ‚ÄòYes‚Äô or ‚ÄòX‚Äô. Phone/Mobile:  If you want the number to match a specific country, the value you enter must start with +[country code], e.g. +44 for the UK. It is only possible to use the country codes already in the list. Once you have entered all the data, save the file and import it via  Import  button and follow the steps.   Edit employee details from the People section on the web There are two ways to edit the details of an employee in the People section; quick edit and full edit.   1. Quick edit The quick edit method allows you to glance over an employee's details, view or add them to Departments, view or add them to Employee groups, and give them  additional access . Press anywhere on the employee list to open the quick edit menu.   2. Full edit The full edit allows you to access and edit all data related to an employee's employment, such as personal and work details, documents, shift and leave overview and much more. You can access full edit by hovering over an employee's name and clicking the  ‚úé  icon to the right or by opening quick edit   and clicking  Edit .     Edit employee details from the schedule To edit details of an employee from the Schedule, you need to ensure you are in the Employee view, as this cannot be done from either the Groups or Positions view. Hover over the employee's name and click the ‚úé icon to open the  Quick edit  menu.     Invite multiple employees to Planday If you want to invite multiple employees in bulk, navigate to  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Send Invitations  and select the Departments you wish to invite. The employees will receive their invites once you press  Send as email , and you will see an overview of which employees the invitation has been sent to.   Because invitations are sent to the employees by e-mail, they must be registered with a valid e-mail address as their username.   Invite employees individually to Planday If you wish to send an invite to an individual employee, navigate to  People  and hover over the employee's name. You can click the middle icon in the list view to invite the employee.   Alternatively, you can open the Quick edit menu and click the invite employee icon.     Send notifications when new employees are created In  Settings  >  Portal settings  >  Notifications  you will find the  New employee created  option.  Add  Employees to this list if you would like them to receive notifications when a new employee has been created in Planday. This may be useful for your management team to keep them up to date with the latest additions to your staff. You can choose to send a Planday message, an SMS, or both.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins and HR Managers.  Before assigning a contract to an employee, consider  setting up contract templates.  This allows you to set up a template of how your contracts can be applied to multiple users using information from their Planday profile with your company‚Äôs standard contract rules. Set Contract templates by going to  Settings  >  People  >  Contract setup.   Once at least one contract is ready, you can create and send a personal contract to an employee. This can be done in two ways:   From the Contracts overview screen You can create a contract from the contract overview screen by going to  People  >  Contracts  >  Create contract.   By editing an employee You can also create a contract for an employee from the employee edit screen by going to  People  >  Employees >  press the employee name >  Edit  > scroll to the  Documents  tab and press  Create  under  the contract  section.   Regardless of the path you took to get to the create button, you will reach the Create contract screen. Select the employee‚Äôs primary  Employee group  to merge the salary information with the contract. Select a contract template that you may have created. Select the  Contract start date  and a contact person, such as yourself or an HR manager as a supervisor. Click  Next  to compose the contract. On the next screen, you will see, depending on your selection of contract: A blank text editor to compose your contract. A filled-in contract template that you selected from the previous step that you can further edit if you need. An attached uploaded document with merge fields that you may have selected while creating your contract. If you are satisfied with the content of the contract, press  Save . You also have the option to download this contract as a PDF file for safekeeping.   The next step highlights the employee that needs to sign the document, shows the creation date of this document, along with expiry date (if applicable), status and two signing options:   Manually : Select this option if the document needs to be signed on paper (printed out) or has already been signed, and a copy should be uploaded for safe keeping with the option to leave comments.    Electronically : Select this option if you want the employee to sign the document electronically through Planday.   If you choose  Electronically , you must complete one more step before sending the document to your employee to collect their signature. You must first sign the document as the employer.    Allow access to Planday before signing contract Secondly, a decision should be made regarding access to use Planday (and the app) for that employee before they sign the contract:  Yes  means your employee can access Planday whether they sign the document or not. You can set reminders to notify employees to sign the contract later. No  means that when an employee opens Planday through the app, they will be notified that they have a document to sign. They will be guided to read and sign the contract before being allowed further. Select  No  if you want your employees to be made aware automatically when they open their Planday app that they have documents to sign. When done, press  Sign and send to employee  to sign the contract yourself and send it to the employee.    The contract will now be sent to the employee, and you can see it on your Contract overview under  People  >  Contracts under  Awaiting action  section.   You will be notified as soon as the employee has signed the document, which will then move under the  Signed contracts  section. üí° If you have an already signed a contract that was created outside of Planday, you can also import this on the employee's profile under  Employees  > edit employee >  Documents . See more about  uploading files and documents here .   Contract notifications and reminders To avoid chasing your employees for contract signatures, you can enable notifications and reminders that can be sent automatically.  Employee contracts  allow you to send an SMS or Planday message to specified employees when they receive a new contract that needs to be signed.  Contract reminders  will send a notification if they have failed to sign a contract after a set time. To set up either of these features, go to  Settings  >  Your organisation  >  Notifications .   You can also add a reminder for contract expiration in case the created contract has had an expiration date.   Need more help?

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For advanced admins. Familiarise yourself with the  Payroll and Revenue  collection of articles. What are Salary codes? Salary codes  in Planday are used to identify and report different shifts, mainly when you use accounting software to process your payroll. They help categorise the shifts and make managing and tracking payroll-related information easier. For example, you can use salary codes to differentiate regular working hours, overtime, sick leave, or any other specific types of shifts for accurate reporting and payroll calculations. When and where can you use Salary codes Salary codes have a hierarchy when placed in different areas of Planday. A general Salary code can be set for all normal Shifts that cover all the hours. This is sufficient under most circumstances.   A Salary code can also be set for each  Employee group . This will overrule the general code to differentiate Shifts belonging to that Employee group.   In rare cases, a Salary code can also be set on each employee's wage. This will overrule the general one and the one set on the Employee group level. üí°  Please keep Salary codes simple and avoid using special characters or punctuation marks, as that may interfere with your payroll integration service. You may use alphanumeric names, for example, Under18 or Full-time, but avoid using complex characters such !partTime&(u18*) ‚Ç¨FullTimer%100Pay. How to set a general Salary code You can set up a general   Salary code for all normal shifts simply by going to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  General.  Scroll down to the  Salary codes  section and set values for regular hourly worked shifts, monthly salaried shifts, or employee purchases.   üí°   If no value has been inserted in the fields above, the default salary code for Hours worked (as per shifts) is 1201 and for Salary, it‚Äôs 1202. These would show in the payroll report. How to set a Salary code on Shift types Another place you can assign Salary codes is on specific  Shift types . This is helpful when you want to distinguish hours as overtime, unpaid leave, sick, or absence.    Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types,  click on an existing Shift type to  edit  and add a Salary code to override the one set in general settings.   In the following example, you can see that all Shifts marked with overtime of 1.5x will be reported under Salary code 1500 so that the payroll software can distinguish those hours from the regular hours. üí° Note that Planday only reports the hours for that Shift type, not the rate. Apply Salary codes to Employee groups Setting up Salary codes for  Employee groups  can be helpful if you want to differentiate the hours for a group of employees or job roles. For example, employees in a clinic need to be paid a different wage than when they work in the reception vs other administrative roles. You could set a Salary code for the Employee group to differentiate Shifts belonging to these employees.   Go to  People  >  Employee groups.  You can add a Salary code to a new group or edit an existing one. The Salary codes set here will override the one set in the  g eneral settings.   Assign a Salary code to an employee There might be situations where you need to differentiate a single employee's hours separate from the rest of the group. For example, an employee may be paid a different rate due to their seniority in the company, so their hours need to be reported separately in payroll. Setting an individual salary code for this employee would be the way to go, so it overrides the general Salary code and any of the group rates. Go to  People  >  Employees  > click the  edit  employee button on an employee you wish to change > switch to the  Employment  tab > scroll down to  Employee groups  >  Edit . You can assign a personal Salary code to this employee by editing their Employee group relation. üí° For scalability, we generally don't recommend applying a Salary code on the employee level but use it through  Employee groups  instead.

What is a Payroll export? A  Payroll export  is a file summarising the values you need to generate payroll. A report is generated based on the data in your Planday, such as approved shifts, assigned pay/salary, pay supplements, breaks and more.   A payroll data export can be generated at any time and done individually per employee or for the entire Department or Employee group. The end of a month or pay period is a typical time to do this but you can export this report anytime as it does not modify or change any data. How to export a Payroll report To do this, navigate to  Payroll  >  Payroll export.   Here you can select from a date from payroll interval, select which employees to include in your report and set advance export options to customise your report.    Set Payroll interval data Select which  Pay periods  to include in your report. You can choose Monthly, Fortnightly, Weekly or Four-weekly. By default, all will be included in your report. Select a period from the  Date interval  to run your report. Under  Salaries , select how you want to calculate fixed salaries in the export if the dates do not fit the specified period. Select employees to include in your report Filter by Departments or Employee types to be considered for the report.  By default,  all employees  will be part of the report, but you can filter for individual employees by selecting  Custom selection of employees  >  Select employees  button. Here you can  search  for an employee or  filter  based on  Employee groups .  Select optional Advanced export options Define further export options such as shift status (approved / unapproved / all shifts),  Sorting of the export data (by Employee name, Salary identifier or username)  Set a format to generate the report as a CSV, Microsoft Excel file, or any payroll integration file format. Select how you would like to preview the file as a PDF or HTML file. Once you have made your settings, click on  Prepare report  button in the top right. You will then receive a preview and an option to download the file in your selected file format.    Checking the downloaded payroll data report before processing them in the final payroll is advisable to spot any undesirable data.   Need more help?

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For advanced admins. Read the  Overview of Payroll supplements  to get acquainted with the Payroll supplements in Planday.   Payroll supplements are an automatic way to add extra payments to shifts or parts of shifts. This can be useful for setting overtime, weekend, or night rates. In this article, you‚Äôll see some examples of commonly used Payroll supplements and how to set them up. Since they are only examples for each type of supplement, you might need to tweak them to fit your needs.    You can create payroll supplements by navigating  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement .    Remember that as soon as you add a Payroll supplement, it might be applied to all the hours in your schedule unless you specify a time range. Make sure to take this into account before you do a pay run. üí° Please note that payroll supplements will be applied backdated (from the beginning of the payroll period). We recommend that you set them up when a new payroll period starts or very soon after. Normal supplement Normal supplements are best used when rates are affected by specific times of the day.      Weekend supplement In this example, you will be looking at using a Normal supplement to add a weekend monetary rate to the system. Specifically, for all the hours worked on a Saturday or a Sunday, an extra ¬£10 per hour worked needs to be added.   Supplement type : Choose Normal supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easy to identify in the future. Hourly wage : As you want to add an extra ¬£10 per  hour , you need to change the Hourly Wage to ‚Äò¬£ monetary‚Äô (currency value depending on your Planday setup). Start type : It should be left as ‚Äò Hour ‚Äô if you want the supplement to be controlled from a start and end time. If you choose the option ‚ÄúRelative to shift‚Äù in Start type, it will allow you to start the supplement after a certain number of minutes into the shift. For example, by choosing the value ‚Äò240‚Äô, the supplement starts after the employee‚Äôs shift has lasted 240 mins (4 hours). Duration refers to how long the supplement should last in minutes. Payment period : Enter ‚Äô00:00‚Äô in  Start and End time  as you are looking at applying this supplement to any hour worked on the weekend. If you have a specific time period in mind, you could enter this here. Salary code : The salary code can be set to ‚ÄòWeekend supplement‚Äô, so it can be easy to identify on the payroll export. Payroll : Add 10 into the payroll box to give a ¬£10 supplement. Days of the week : The days should be Saturday and Sunday Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Night supplement In this example, you will be looking at using a Normal supplement to add a percentage-controlled supplement to the hours the employees work at night on weekdays.   Supplement type : Choose Normal supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easy to identify in the future. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Start type : It should be left as ‚Äò Hour ‚Äô as you want the supplement to be controlled from a start and end time. Payment period : Enter ‚Äô20:00‚Äô in  Start  and ‚Äô06:00‚Äô in  End  as you are looking at applying this supplement to the hours between 8 pm. and 6 am. Don‚Äôt forget to tick the option ‚ÄúAllow over midnight‚Äù further down. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Add 30 into the payroll box to give a 30% increase for each hour the employees work between 8 pm. and 6 am. Days of the week : Choose the days of the week here Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Bank holiday supplement This example shows a Bank holiday supplement that applies a 50% additional pay for each hour worked on a public holiday.   Supplement type : Choose Normal supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easy to identify in the future. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Start type : It should be left as ‚Äò Hour ‚Äô as you want the supplement to be controlled from a start and end time. Payment period : Enter ‚Äô00:00‚Äô in  Start and End time  as you are looking at applying this supplement to any hour worked on a Bank holiday. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Add 50 into the payroll box to give a 50% increase for each hour of the Bank holiday day the employees work. Days of the week : Select none here as the supplement should be applied only on Bank holiday days. Days from the Bank Holiday calendar : Select the relevant  Bank holiday calendar  that includes the days when the supplement should apply. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Weekdays (specific time range) This example shows a supplement that applies a 25% additional pay for each hour worked between 7 pm. and 11 pm. on weekdays.   Supplement type : Choose Normal supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easily identifiable in the future. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Start type : It should be left as ‚Äò Hour ‚Äô as you want the supplement to be controlled from a start and end time.

Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Week-based supplement Week-based supplements are helpful when you want to create a supplement based on the number of hours someone has worked in a week (e.g. overtime rates).  In this example, employees will be supplemented in a ‚ÄòTime and a Half‚Äô manner, so 150% of their rate, when they work over 40 hours a week.   Supplement type : Choose Week-based supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easy to identify in the future. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Payment period (1) : It can be set to 00:00 ‚Äì 00:00, to include any hours worked on any given day. Payment period (2) : The ‚ÄòFrom‚Äô field related to Hours (in the Payment period) would be 40 in this case, as you want all hours over 40 to have the supplement attached. Then set the ‚ÄòTo‚Äô hours to a maximum ( in this case, 1000), so all hours of the week will be included in the calculation. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Add 50 into the payroll box to to supplement the wage with an extra ‚Äòhalf‚Äô. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Do not enter 150%, as this would actually give employees 250% of their wage, for the applicable hours. Days of the week : Select the days of the week here. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Day-based supplement Day-based supplements can be used when you want to supplement any time worked over a certain number of hours, per single day of work. It could be used if the employees work more than one shift per day.   For this example, when an employee works over 9 hours in a single day, they will receive double the pay for the extra hours.   Supplement type : Choose Day-based supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Payment period (1) : It can be set to 00:00 ‚Äì 00:00 to include any hours worked on any given day. Payment period (2) : The ‚ÄòFrom‚Äô hours should be set to 9 (overtime threshold) and the ‚ÄòTo‚Äô hours should be set to a maximum (in this case, 24). Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Set the Payroll percentage to 100%, as you want to supplement the pre-existing rate with 100%. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Do not enter 200%, as this would give employees 300% of their wage for the applicable hours. Days of the week : Select the days of the week here. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Contract rules supplement Use Contract rules supplements if you were manually calculating and paying for overtime. For example, you can  set a contract rule  for employees that calculates and pays them automatically if they exceed a certain number of hours.   In the example below, a Contract rules supplement is being applied to all employees having the  Intern 80 Hrs  contract rule whereby their maximum monthly hours should be 80. Exceeding that 80 hours limit would give them ¬£15 extra pay on top of their hourly rate for each hour worked above 80.   Supplement type : Choose Contract rules supplement Contract rule : Select for which Contract rule the supplement should apply. Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description. Hourly wage : Since this will be a fixed increment, select ‚Äò¬£ (monetary)‚Äô. Payment period : For the supplement to kick in after working 80 hours, set the  From  to 0 hours and the  To  to 20 hours paying ¬£15 extra. The  To  value is the maximum number of hours until which the supplement should be applied for. So any hours beyond 80, in this case the extra 20 hours, will be given a ¬£15 supplement on top of the regular pay. Reset frequency : You can select either per day or per contract rule interval. The selected value of  Reset frequency  determines if the overtime rates should reset per day or if they should follow the interval of the contract rule. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Set the monetary increase of ¬£15 to be paid to any hours beyond 80, on top of the hourly wage. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details.   The payroll report would show the contract rule applied when the employee exceeds their 80 scheduled hours threshold. You can see this supplement applied when you export the payroll report from  Payroll  >  Payroll export  >  Prepare report .   Reset frequency - use case In the example below, the employee is contracted to work 25 hours per week but is working 37h 30min from Monday to Friday. The employee then works 12h 30 min overtime.    The following Contract rules supplement is created:    The employee will be paid an additional 100% of the normal rate for overtime hours and the supplement will apply after 2 hours (1.) Reset frequency  is set to Per day (2.), therefore the supplement will trigger when the employee has worked more than 25 hours per week and will apply after 2 hours of overtime  every day .  The supplement will look like this in the payroll report:   If we use the Reset frequency option  Per Contract rule interval , the supplement will trigger when the employee has worked more than 25 hours per week and will apply after 2 hours of overtime, on  all hours  until the next weekly interval starts.        Manual supplement These supplements are used when you manually want to add supplements to your employees, such as bonuses. It applies directly to the shift in the schedule. You can set a fixed amount per shift or per hour. You can create a manual supplement under  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement  >  Manual supplement > Create fixed manual supplement/Create manual supplement. There are two kinds of manual supplements.  The  manual supplement ‚Äî  calculated per hour and the amount can‚Äôt be edited when the supplement is added to the shift. The  fixed manual supplement ‚Äî  calculated for the entire shift and you can edit the amount when you add the supplement to the shift. In the example below, a fixed manual supplement is created for the employees who are on call and who have to come and work extra. They would get a ¬£30 supplement on their ‚ÄúEmergency shift‚Äù.   Name and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description Block normal supplements:  Choose whether or not this supplement should block other supplements Employee groups:  Select which Employee groups this supplement should be applied Shift types:  Select the Shift types where the supplement can apply Employee types:  Select which Employee types this supplement should be applied for Bank Holiday calendar:  If you don‚Äôt select any days of the week further down, choose the Bank holiday calendar the supplement should be applied to Payroll:  Set the monetary increase of ¬£30 to be added to the shift‚Äôs pay Salary code:  Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Days of the week:  Select which days of the week the supplement can be applicable. Valid from/Valid to:  Set when the supplement comes into effect or ends.

My metrics are not showing anything for some of the days in my Schedule. Why? This could mean that there is no data to show for those days, which can be the result of empty cells in your Data set input table or a signal that your formula is not giving a mathematically correct result for every day. You should head over to your overview page (  Reports  >  Data Center  ), select the metric that's problematic, and try to find the missing data in its components.   If you are using a complex setup (extensive formula metrics referenced used in a joint formula metric ), you might want to toggle on the option to  Show this formula as an option to be displayed in Schedule  for some of them, to have a way to compare and follow how the data is transformed from one formula to another. Remember that you can always contact our  support team  for assistance. The numbers shown on my Schedule don't make sense. What's going on? Because the Formulas feature can host complicated operations, sometimes your metrics might not behave as expected. To understand what's going on, it might be useful to compare what you expected to happen versus what is actually happening. For instance, if you expect a metric to count a shift you just assigned as 1 but instead, the metric shows a bigger numerical difference, which might indicate that the metric is actually taking into account the number of hours in that shift, rather than the shift itself.  There are a few things you could check to find out what the problem is: if this is happening for a Data set, check what kind of input data your metric is set to (per day or per hour) if you use a Schedule data element in a formula, check whether the element is gathering the data you expect. Hover over the element in the list of actual Schedule data elements and see if that matches your expectations. if you use several mathematical operators in your formulas, check whether the priority of operations is correctly set (the operators follow the arithmetic order of operations, so make sure to use the ""("" and "")"" to mark which operation needs to be calculated first). You've checked everything and the metric results still don't look right? Reach out to our  support team  for assistance. I'm trying to import my data through a CSV file but I get an error. How do I fix it? When importing data from a file, Planday performs a series of checks to make sure that the information in the file is valid. When one of these checks fails, you will see an error: ""The ID in the file is invalid. You can find the correct ID in a newly exported CSV file.""  Every structural level in Planday has a unique ID, that is used throughout the system to reference your Departments, Positions, or Sections. This is very similar to the ID you have to choose for your metrics, the difference being that it is numerical.  The CSV needs to contain the ID for the Department, Position, or Section so that the system can put your data in the right place. When you export a CSV file from the metric you are working on, the first cell will contain the structural level ID.  If that gets accidentally deleted or modified, you simply export another CSV file and copy the ID into the one you want to use for importing. ""The same date cannot be in more than one column. Please correct this and try again"" When you created your Data set, your choice in the Schedule settings defined how the input table needs to look like. Regardless of whether you chose to input data for each day or for each hour, you cannot have the same date twice in your CSV file, much like you do not have the same date twice in your Schedule.  The CSV file should have each column representing a (unique) date, the same way your metric looks on the overview page. ""A shift start time cannot be in more than one row. Please correct this and try again""  or   ""A shift start time can only be set at the beginning of an hour (e.g. 10:00)"" In the same way you cannot have the same date twice in your schedule, you cannot have the same hour appear twice in your CSV file.  Each row of your CSV file would only represent the start of a new hour (e.g 10:00) to limit the number of rows possible to the maximum amount of hours in a day.  If in doubt, you can set up a template Data set to  Input data for each hour  and then use it to export a CSV with the correct hour per row formatting. ""Cannot import [an_entry_from_your_file] as a number. Please adjust it and try again"" All the entries in your CSV file (besides the first column and the first row) should be filled in with numerical values. If a cell contains any other type of data, the system cannot change that in the right shape (for instance, number of shifts needed).  At the same time, please keep in mind, that decimal points might interfere with the formatting of your numerical values, depending on the tool you use to edit/input data in the CSV file. ""Cannot import {0} as a date. Please adjust it and try again"" or ""Cannot import {0} as a shift start time. Please adjust it and try again,"" Date and hour formatting has many variations. Usually, this depends on where your organisation is operating (country) and your settings in Planday (Settings > Your organisation  > General). If you see either of the two errors above when trying to import a CSV file, you should check your hour and date entries to ensure they are consistent and do not contain any unusual characters. The easiest way to fix it would be to export an example CSV file and match the date/hour formatting.

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ This feature, formally called Planning metrics, is included in the  Pro Plan and up .  Reach out to our support team if you'd like to try it out. If you haven't set up any Data Center metrics yet, check out this  article  to see which fits best. With your data sets and formulas set up, it's time to put them to work. You can have your formulas displayed in your schedule exactly where you need them to make informed and data-driven decisions. Viewing Data Center formulas in the schedule Data sets can be shown on the schedule as  Data Center formula  only when included in a  Formula , when referenced through its ID.   For that, you need to create a new metric: a Formula. Creating a Formula is very similar to a Data set, with the addition of a set of formula options. In the Formula field, you just need to type the ID for the metric you want to display (e.g #YOUR_ID) or tap on one of the IDs listed under your available metrics. On the Schedule page, the metric will be placed depending on the structure level it applies for. Also, the unit type you chose for your metric, will determine how it will look. Please note that if there is data missing from your metrics for an entire week (some cells in the input table are empty), then the metric will not be displayed at all for that week.   The simplest version of a Formula is the one that is used only to display a Data set in your schedule. Viewing Formula in Schedule Besides simple Data - business metrics, you can use Formula metrics to show the result of operations between different elements.   In order to display your Formula metric in the Schedule, this setting must be toggled on for your metric. If you're not sure about whether or not the setting is toggled on, you can check from  Schedule  >  View Settings > Data Center formulas  then find your metric in the list, on the left, and tap on the edit icon ‚úèÔ∏è. If the option is not visible on your screen, check out this  article  about editing metrics.   Once you toggle it on, your metric should automatically display on the Schedule view. Depending on the unit type and the time setting you chose when you set it up, your metric may appear like a histogram or numbers, for each day/hour.   Please keep in mind that Data Center formulas visibility in the Schedule is related to the permissions and security settings defined for your organization. For instance, if your data sets reference payroll data, you must be an  Admin  to view the Data Center formulas section. More details about the permission levels can be found  here .   To see and read your metric data correctly, you should take into account: whether your formula uses values that are unique to each position within a specific department. If so, you should make sure to read the formula results for positions in that department. The same formula might show incorrect values (or no values at all) in a different department or at a different level (e.g. section). whether your formula uses values that are global or unique to each department. If that is the case, you may want to include it in other Formula metrics that yield results unique for each position (within a specific department), so that the data carries more meaning and takes the context into account. whether a formula metric is included in another metric. In this case, you might want to show only the latter, to avoid confusion or duplicates on your Schedule. which structural level your metric contains data for.  As explained in the setup  guide  for Data Center Formulas, the rule of thumb is that formulas need to match the level of the lowest structural level contained in your business metric. The order is  Global  (or portal) ‚Üí  Department  ‚Üí  Section  ‚Üí  Position , following the  structure  used in Planday. The way your Data Center formulas are shown in your schedule may change depending on the date range view (Day, Week, or 2 weeks). Your metrics will not be visible in the Month view.   Lastly, if everything is set up correctly but you can't find your metrics in the Schedule, or they don't appear to be correct, you can read through our  FAQ article  to find possible solutions or you can contact our support team for assistance.

If you'd like to see how this feature works and have a say in how it shapes up, please contact us to join the beta testing group.    Setup of Metrics N.B. this is a general guide for using the Business Metrics feature, see below (‚ÄúDemand Planning scenario setup‚Äù) for more specific details on how to set up for demand planning.   Creating Business Metrics: Data In the schedule page, click on the ‚ÄúBusiness metrics‚Äù button.   In the Business metrics page, click on ‚ÄúCreate business metric‚Äù   Now, select the ‚ÄúData‚Äù type, and then enter a name, ID (only capitals and underscores are allow), select a unit, and click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù   You will need to select if you want to enter values for each hour or day, and whether these should be global values (that is to say, not connected to anything in the schedule) or unique for each department, or unique for each position/section within a department. Then click ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù N.B. It is not possible to create a business metric that only applies to a single position or section, but if you only assign values to one position or section then the results will only be visible there.   Creating Business Metrics: Formulas In order to view these values in the schedule, compare them with actual data, or transform them in some way, you will also need to create a formula. After clicking to create a new business metric, choose the ‚ÄúFormula‚Äù option, and assign name, ID and unit as outlined above. Now you will need to enter a formula:    if you only enter a business metric ID from the list (such as the one created in the first step), then the result of this formula will only be to show these values in the schedule if you would like to compare a metric with actual values, then you can use one of the six examples given in blue: assignedshiftsdaily () will give you the total number of assigned hours per day per position assignedshiftshourly () will give you the number of worked hours per hour per position assignedsectionshiftsdaily () will give you the total number of assigned hours per day per section assignedsectionshiftshourly () will give you the number of worked hours per hour per section countAssignedShiftsPerPositionDaily () will give you the number of assigned shifts per position countAssignedShiftsPerSectionDaily () will give you the number of assigned shifts per section openshiftsdaily () will give you the total number of open hours per day per position openshiftshourly () will give you the number of open shift hours per hour per position opensectionshiftsdaily () will give you the total number of Open hours per day per section opensectionshiftshourly () will give you the number of open shift hours per hour per section countOpenShiftsPerPositionDaily () will give you the number of Open shifts per position countOpenShiftsPerSectionDaily () will give you the number of Open shifts per section use the operators (+, -, and so on) and numbers to combine and/or modify the business metric values and actuals. For example: ‚Äúassignedshiftsdaily() - #TARGET_ASSIGNED_HOURS‚Äú would show the difference between the hours you have scheduled and the target hours (a negative number would indicate you haven‚Äôt assigned enough hours, a position one that you have assigned too many hours) ‚Äú#TARGET_ASSIGNED_HOURS * 2‚Äù would display double the amount of target hours Click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù to contine   Now you‚Äôll need to choose where the results of the formula should be displayed. Be careful to make sure that your formula is displayed in a place that matches with the contents of the formula. As a rule, formulas need to match the level of the lowest level business metric it contains. The order is: global > department > section > position.   If your formula uses values that are unique to each position within department A, you should make sure the formula is also displayed for positions in department A. Showing in sections in department B, for example, would result in no values being shown. If your formula uses values that are global, or unique to each department, you may wish to combine these with other values that are unique for each position within department A. If so, the formula should be set to be viewed for positions in department A. You can then select if you wish this formula to be shown in the schedule or not. Remember that a formula can be used within another formula, which is a good reason for not having it be displayed in the schedule along with the formula that uses it.   Note : Actuals only calculate data for Sections and positions in a department. Do not create a formula with scope Global or Department if you wish to use Actuals. This is a currently a limitation.   Adding values to Data-based Business Metrics In the Business Metrics page, simply select the metric for which you‚Äôd like to add values, scroll to the week for which you want to enter data using the date picker, type in the data and click ‚ÄúSave changes‚Äù. You can enter for multiple weeks at a time before clicking ‚ÄúSave changes‚Äù, but if you click away from this view before saving then you will need to re-enter the data.   Please be aware that there is a difference between entering a zero and keeping the formula blank: a zero will be used in calculations in a formula, whereas a blank space (such as the ones you can see in the bottom positions in the example above) will not be calculated at all.    Editing and deletion of Business Metrics In the list of metrics you see on the left, you can click on the pencil icon that appears next to them on hover to edit or delete the metric. Keep in mind that at the moment the only elements that can be edited are the name, the unit, and whether a formula is visible or not. You can also delete a metric from here (keep in mind that deleting a metric could result in breaking a formula that is using that metric).   View in Schedule How and when Business Metrics are displayed As mentioned above, in order for data to appear in the schedule, it needs to be included in a formula (the simplest version of such a formula is one that only contains the metric tag). If no data is entered for the metric for the week you are looking at in the schedule, then the metric will not be displayed at all.   Demand Planning scenario setup Please refer to the guide above for details on each step:   Create one data Business Metric for each department:  Unit: number of shifts Time unit: input data for each day Assign: Assign different values to individual positions within a department Create one formula for each department: Unit: number of shifts Formula: ‚Äúassignedshiftsdaily() - #BM‚Äù (where BM is the data based business metric for that department) Assign: Assign different values to individual positions within a department Toggle visibility: On Enter demand for positions in each data-based metric In the schedule you will now start to see the metric and the daily numbers. A negative number means that there are not enough assigned shifts to cover the demand, zero means you have perfectly matched the demand, a positive number means you have exceeded the demand. What does not count as an assigned shifts: drafts, open shifts, exclusive open shifts (options to include these will be prioritized in future) Did this answer your question? üòû üòê üòÉ"

Here's what's new: Web: Updated Edit salary form We have updated the form for  editing your employees‚Äô salaries  with a new design and minor improvements. The functionality is still the same as you are used to, but some things are moved around to make it more intuitive for you to use and provide a fresh look and better overview.   You can explore the changes by going to  People  >  Employees  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Edit salary .     Added support for  Salary periods Besides a monthly salary, we now support more salary periods. This will allow you to define the fixed salary amount the employee is entitled to get paid over a year, month, fortnight or week.   The Salary period is selected per employee and can be found under  People  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Edit salary .   For your employees with a fixed salary amount already set up, the Salary period will still be per month. This means that nothing changes in your current setup.     Added support for  Pay periods We are also introducing  Pay periods  for processing payroll, where you can select how often your employees get paid. The Pay periods that are supported are weekly, fortnightly, and monthly. This applies to both an hourly wage and a fixed salary.   From  People  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Pay periods , you can now select a Pay period for each employee.   The default Pay period is monthly, and this is preselected for all your employees unless you change it. When processing your payroll from  Payroll  >  Payroll export , you can select which Pay periods to include.     Paid breaks From  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Break rules , you can set up  Break rules  that will be added to the Schedule automatically. You can also add breaks manually on a shift-by-shift basis from the  Schedule .  We have now added the option to set a break as  Paid  when creating a new or editing an existing Break rule.   When adding a break directly to a shift in the Schedule, you can also select if the break is Unpaid or Paid.   Paid breaks will appear in reports the same as unpaid breaks, but the employee's wage will not be deducted during the break. Nothing changes in your current setup of breaks. The breaks you currently have are still set to unpaid unless you manually change the type.   App: Improved shift transactions and shift details We have improved the accessibility and layout when you request open shifts, swap or hand over with colleagues, and set your shifts for sale.  Additionally, the shift details now include the time and duration of breaks.   Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 8.1.2 ) or iOS ( 8.1.0 ).    Integrations & Open API: Personio (HR integration for the UK, France, Germany and Spain) With the Personio integration, you can import your employees and their leave data directly into Planday. The data can be imported manually, or you select to have it imported automatically once a day. This way, you will have the data where and when you need it. Read more about  How to connect Personio to Planday .   New Open API endpoints In an effort to extend our API coverage, we added support for endpoints related to the HR API and Absence API. HR API We are introducing a new  Employee Account Management  controller. Using this controller, you can control your employees' credentials and help them access their Planday accounts. Absence API We are introducing  Adjustments  endpoints. With this, you can read and create adjustments on accrued absence/leave accounts to update your employee‚Äôs balances. You can find more details on our Open API documentation at  openapi.planday.com . üí° See regularly updated articles and videos on how to use Planday in our  Help Centre  and  video collection .

How to handle the Departments limit üí°  Your Planday  subscription plan  defines your maximum number of Departments. On the Starter plan, you are limited to having 1 Department, while the Plus and Pro plans allow up to 5 or more Departments. When in doubt, check with the Planday support team. If necessary, upgrade to a plan that allows enough Departments. Departments that would go over the limit and employees assigned to it will not be created in the import.   How are employees assigned to Departments in the import? You define in the integration setup, which of your Personio entities  should correlate to a Planday Department . In the import, employees will be added to Planday Departments as follows: If there are Departments with matching names, employees will be added to them. In that case, your total number of Departments would be unaffected. If there is no Department with a matching name, the system will try to add Departments named after the Personio entity. This would affect your total number of Departments. If you import employees from Personio with no value in the required field, they will be assigned to a newly created fallback Department called  Personio . This would affect your total number of Departments.   How do I ensure an uninterrupted, complete import of employees? When applicable, match the name of a Planday Department with the name of the Personio entity you want to have connected to it. In Personio, check the number of entities that would be imported by going to  Settings  >  Organization . Consult Planday‚Äôs support team to make sure you know your maximum number of allowed Departments. If necessary, upgrade to another plan. Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  This integration is for Planday admins based in Australia, the UK and the USA only. With Planday you can connect your  Square  merchant accounts and automatically import revenue data from different Square Locations into Planday Revenue units. Requirements for the integration For this integration to work, two prerequisites in Planday must be completed.   Setup Revenue units in Planday To get this integration working, you must map Planday‚Äôs Revenue units with Square‚Äôs Locations to fetch revenue data. Before setting up the integration, create at least one Revenue unit in every Department where you wish to import revenue.  To set up a revenue unit in Planday, go to  Settings  > Under the  Reports  heading, press  Revenue  >  Create. When setting up a Revenue unit, make sure to select  Enter daily revenue  for every unit you want to map and also select  Include in total revenue .   üí° For detailed steps, use the  Revenue in Planday  article.   Create Shifts on business days where revenue should be imported Revenue can only be imported into business days of your schedule. To create a business day in your schedule, make sure to schedule at least one Shift for the given day. Setup the integration in Planday Follow these steps to find, connect and configure the integration.   Find and connect the integration Once the prerequisites have been completed, go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview.  Switch to the  Point of Sale  tab to see all available POS integrations or search for the integration name from the search bar.    Click  Connect  on the Square tile to open the integration editor. During this step, the integration gains access to Planday data.   Connect new merchant Connect one or more Square  merchants  (i.e., Square accounts) in the first card in the integration editor.   To connect a Square account, click the  Connect merchant  button, which will open a Square log-in screen in a new window. ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your browser is not blocking pop-up windows, in which case the Square log-in window will not open. After signing in, check the Merchants table, which shows your newly connected account. The green status icon will inform you that the connection is set up correctly.   In case of issues with the Square account connection, a dedicated status and an orange status light will be displayed in the table.   Data import settings When at least one merchant is connected successfully, you can complete the integration setup by specifying other settings and mappings.  Start import at  -  Choose an hour.  The integration imports revenue once daily at the hour specified in the  Start import at  field. The imports will take place within the specified hour, typically close to the start of the hour. Get data from the past  -  Choose the number of days.  This field allows you to specify how many days worth of data should be imported. The minimum number of days is 1, meaning the integration only imports data from the previous day. üí° When selecting more than one day, previously imported revenue on mapped Revenue units is overwritten during every import. It is possible the imported values can change over the first several days as payments get processed on Square‚Äôs side. The integration imports only payments marked as  Complete  in Square.   Map Locations and Revenue units Click the  Link location  button in the Locations card to open the mapping window.  At least one Revenue unit in Planday is required  for this step.   The linking page shows all Revenue units and allows you to select any Square Location to map. It is possible to map multiple Revenue units to one Square location and vice versa.   Click  Save  to accept all changes. Alternatively, close the window or click the Back button to discard the changes.   Revenue Import Details Integration timing The integration imports revenue data from Square once a day. The import takes place within one hour starting at the hour selected in the  Start import at  field.  Typically, the import runs near the beginning of the specified interval.    Tax Always Included Integration always imports Gross value from mapped locations. There is no option to import Net value or get information about Tax level or Tax value separately.  Revenue Value The imported revenue is the sum of revenue values of all active Locations mapped to the Revenue Unit from successfully connected Merchant accounts. If any merchant connection does not work, revenue from the merchant‚Äôs locations will not count in the revenue imported into the mapped Revenue units.   ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that incomplete revenue values will overwrite correct values imported in the past if a Merchant account connection stops working and if you are importing values for several days in the past.   FAQs and troubleshooting Merchant account needs to be reconnected. In some instances, authorization to the connected account can fail, and the account will need to be reconnected. The user will be informed of that state in the Merchants card where such status will be displayed next to the corresponding account. How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, the user must remove all connected merchants. This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be deleted and stays in Planday.  How can I verify imported values? Verify in Planday:  Open the  Schedule  page on Planday. Press the  View settings  button,  turn on the Revenue toggle  to reveal revenue values at the bottom of each Schedule day.   Revenue imported for a given revenue unit is displayed in the  Daily revenue  pop-up. üí° Note that the Notes field contains the timestamp of the revenue import and a label of the revenue source. The shown timestamp reflects the  UCT time zone , and it is not adjusted for your Planday organisation‚Äôs location! Verify in Square:  Open your  Square Seller dashboard   https://squareup.com/dashboard  and log in using the same merchant account you used to connect with Planday. Navigate to  Reporting , then  Transactions .   Set relevant values in the filter: The date should reflect the period you are checking. Set types to  Payments . Set the status to  Complete .

Square sign-in window is not showing Make sure that your browser is not blocking pop-up windows. This can often lead to the log-in window not appearing. If possible, try opening Planday on a different browser. Revenue not importing Make sure that there is at least one Shift in the Schedule on each day where revenue should be imported. Ensure that the  Enter daily revenue  checkbox, located in  Settings  >  Revenue , is selected for mapped Revenue units. Verify that Square locations are mapped to Revenue units of relevant Departments in Planday.

Once you sign in, the connection status will be updated in the table. When an account needs to be reconnected, its revenue will not be imported into Planday, meaning that you might notice unusually low revenue shown on the Schedule. To remedy this, after reconnecting the account, you can increase the number of imported days to overwrite days showing partial revenue figures. Revenue imported to Planday does not match the value reported by Square Check Payments Status  The integration calculates revenue based only on payments marked as  Complete . Since payments can take up to a few days to be processed, it is possible that imported revenue will not correspond to values shown in Square, or that the value shown in Schedule will change during the next import. If you wish to compare values more accurately, filter transactions in Square by the  Completed  status. Check Connection Status  Please check that all connections are in  Connected  status. If a connection doesn‚Äôt work correctly, then Payments related to Locations from this connection will not be imported. Need more help?

With Planday, you can connect your Lightspeed Retail (X-Series - formerly Vend) POS system and automatically import sales data. This lets you compare your revenue vs payroll costs and helps you plan your schedules to align with the budget. You can connect different X-Series Outlets or individual Registers in those Outlets into Planday Revenue units. Follow this setup guide to configure the integration.   Requirements for the integration For this integration to work, you must complete two prerequisites in Planday. 1. Set up Revenue units in Planday To get this integration working, you must map Planday‚Äôs Revenue units with Lightspeed‚Äôs Registers/Outlets to fetch revenue data. Before setting up the integration, create at least one  Revenue unit  in every Department where you wish to import revenue.  To set up a Revenue unit in Planday, go to  Settings  > under the  Reports  heading, press  Revenue  >  Create. When setting up a Revenue unit, select the option to  Enter daily revenue  for every unit you want to map, along with selecting  Include in total revenue,  as shown in the screenshot below.   üí° For detailed steps, read the  Revenue in Planday  article. 2. Create Shifts on business days where revenue should be imported Revenue can only be imported into business days of your schedule. To create a business day in your schedule, ensure that there is at least one Shift for the given day where you wish to import revenue.  Set up the integration in Planday Follow these steps to find, connect and configure the integration.  Find and connect the integration Once the prerequisites have been completed, go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview.  Switch to the  Point of Sale  tab to see all available POS integrations or search for the integration name from the search bar.   Click  Connect  on the  Lightspeed Retail (X-Series)  tile to open the integration editor. During this step, the integration gains access to Planday data. Connect Lightspeed account Connect one or more Lightspeed POS (X-Series)  Accounts  in the first card in the integration editor by pressing the  Connect account  button.   This will open a log-in screen in a new pop-up window. You must enter your Store URL here, followed by your Vend email and password. ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your browser is not blocking pop-up windows, in which case the log-in window will not open. After signing in, check the Accounts section of the integration, which shows your newly connected account. The green  status  icon üü¢ will inform you that the connection is set up correctly. üí° In case of issues with the connection, a dedicated status message and light will be displayed in front of the account. You can click on the status to read more or take further action if required.   Data import settings When at least one account is connected successfully, you can complete the integration setup by specifying other settings and mappings.  Start import at  -  Choose an hour of the day.  The integration imports revenue data daily at the hour specified in this field. The imports will take place within the set hour, typically close to the start of the hour.  Get data from the past  -  Choose the number of days.  This field allows you to specify how many days of previous data should be imported. The minimum number of days is 1, meaning the integration only imports data from the previous day.  üí°  When selecting more than one day, previously imported revenue on mapped Revenue units is overwritten during every import. The imported values may change over the first several days as payments get processed on Lightspeed‚Äôs side.  Include tax values  -  Choose Yes or No.  By default, the checkbox to include tax values is selected, but you can deselect it - leading to the import of Net sales data.   Link Planday Revenue units with Lightspeed POS Registers or Outlets üí°  At least  one Revenue unit in Planday  is required for this step. Click one of the account names under Registers to open the link window. The linking page shows existing Planday Revenue units and allows you to link any Lightspeed POS (X-Series) Register. It is possible to map multiple Registers in the same Outlet to one Revenue unit and vice versa.   Click  Save  to confirm the mappings. Alternatively, close the window or click the Back button to discard the links. Revenue import details Integration timing The integration imports revenue data from Lightspeed once a day. The import takes place within one hour starting at the selected hour in the  Start import at  field.  Typically, the import runs near the beginning of the specified interval.  Include or exclude tax values Integration by default imports Gross values from mapped locations. To import Net values, uncheck the ‚Äú Include tax values ‚Äù option. Revenue value The imported revenue is the sum of revenue values of all active Registers mapped to the Revenue unit from successfully connected Lightspeed accounts. If any Lightspeed account connection does not work, revenue from the Account‚Äôs registers will not count in the revenue imported into the mapped Revenue units. ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that incomplete revenue values will overwrite correct values imported in the past if a Lightspeed account connection stops working and if you are importing values for several days in the past. FAQs and troubleshooting How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, you can remove individual connected Lightspeed accounts. This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be overwritten.  üí° Alternatively, click the  Options  drop-down on the Lightspeed Retail X-Series tile on the Integrations Overview page, then click  Revoke authorisation . This will revoke the integration‚Äôs access to Planday and stop all scheduled import jobs.     How can I verify imported values? To verify in Planday:  Open the  Schedule  page on Planday. Press the  View settings  button, and  turn on  the  Revenue  toggle to reveal earnings values at the bottom of each business day. Revenue imported for a given Revenue unit is displayed in the  Daily revenue  pop-up. üí° Note that the Notes field contains the timestamp of the revenue import and a label of the revenue source. The shown timestamp reflects the  UCT time zone  and is not adjusted for your Planday organisation‚Äôs location! To Verify in Lightspeed:  The data in X-Series can be checked under your Lightspeed dashboard. Browse   your store account in Lightspeed and navigate  Menu  >  Sell  >  Sales History . Nothing happens when I click Connect account Ensure your browser is not blocking pop-up windows, which can often lead to the log-in window not appearing.   Revenue not importing Ensure that there is at least one Shift on the Schedule for each day where revenue should be imported. Ensure that the  Enter daily revenue  checkbox, located in  Settings  >  Revenue , is selected for mapped revenue units. Verify that Lightspeed Retail X-Series registers are mapped to Revenue units of relevant Departments.   The account needs to be reconnected In some instances, authorisation to the connected account can fail, and the account will need to be reconnected. You can see the current status of the connected accounts displayed next to the corresponding account when you open the integration tile. To reconnect the account, you must click on the account‚Äôs table row in the Accounts section. A pop-up window asking you to sign in again will appear. You must log in to the correct X-series account. Once you sign in, the connection status will be updated in the table. ‚ö†Ô∏è When an account needs to be reconnected, its revenue will not be imported into Planday, meaning that you might notice unusually low revenue shown in the Schedule. To remedy this, after reconnecting the account, you can increase the number of imported days to overwrite days showing partial revenue figures.   Revenue imported to Planday does not match the value reported by Vend A. Vend ‚Äì Rounding issue Sometimes, the sale total will have some rounding calculation (more or less ~GBP0.01) due to tax calculations not falling on an exact penny value. When these fractional pennies accumulate over many sales, the differences can be seen more evidently.  This issue occurs only when tax is included in the import. B. Check Payments Status  The integration calculates revenue based on sales marked as: Completed On Account Delivery, completed Layby, completed On account, completed Pickup, completed Pickup, unfulfilled Delivery, unfulfilled Since payments can take up to a few days to be processed, it is possible that imported revenue will not correspond to values shown in X-Series or that the value shown in the Schedule will change on the next import.  C. Check Connection Status  Please check once all connections are in  Connected  status. If some connection doesn‚Äôt work properly, sales related to Registers from this connection will not be imported.   Can I connect several Lightspeed accounts to the same Planday organisation? Yes, it's possible. To add another Lightspeed account to your Planday,  go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  find the relevant Lightspeed integration tile and click on  Connect click on  Connect account  and add the details of that second connection Then, you can link the relevant revenue units ( corresponding to the departments) to the relevant Lightspeed Registers.

If you are using the filters, you need to add from and to dates by clicking ‚ÄúEdit‚Äù and selecting dates at the bottom. This is to specify the date range for the user creations, changes, hire dates, or deactivation dates to have occurred, for them to be included in this report download. Select  Download , when ready. Your file will be downloaded onto your computer, and you should be able to find it in the location for your downloaded files. If you need to search for the file, please look for a file name that starts with  Hogia_ .   4 - Import the file in Hogia Before you start this step, please be aware that by importing the report Hogia will automatically create new, update, or deactivate employee data in Hogia, based on the data that is in the file. You can open up the file on a text editor to check its content if you are unsure what data is included. If you have questions about how this works, please see the  Frequently Asked Questions  below. When you are ready, follow the steps below: In Hogia, go to  Arkiv  >  Import  >  Anst√§llda  to begin the import. Then select the file that you downloaded from Planday. Please see the full instructions provided by Hogia Help Center (Swedish)  https://www.kundtorg.hogia.se/fraga?id=6256   Frequently Asked Questions Will new employees in Planday, automatically be created in Hogia? Yes, if the file includes a salary identifier that does not exist in Hogia yet, a new employee entry will be created in Hogia. So when you create the new employees in Planday, make sure you give them a salary identifier that does not exist yet.   What will happen if I have updated an employee‚Äôs data in Planday? If the salary identifier of the employee already exists in Hogia, any changes to any of the employee fields will overwrite data in the respective fields in Hogia.   What will happen if I have deactivated an employee in Planday? If you have set a deactivation date for an employee in Planday, the employee will become inactive in Hogia on the specified date. This is because the import will make sure that the field ‚ÄúAvg√•ngsdatum‚Äù in Hogia is updated with the new date.   Why is the hourly rate field not updated? Firstly, double-check that you have selected the hourly rate field and saved the integration settings correctly, as shown in this guide. Secondly, please check that the employee has a valid hourly rate in Planday in People > Employees > Edit (select the pencil icon to edit one employee or select the employee and click the Edit button) > Groups and Wages. The valid from date on the hourly rate should not be in the future. Also, if the employee has several employee groups, the hourly rate for one employee must be identical in all their groups. If an employee has different rates in Planday, this field will be blank in the file for this employee.    What data does the ‚ÄúFull Bank Account‚Äù field include? This includes both the Reg Num (Sweden: Clearing number) and the account number. If you select the Bank Account field instead, this will not include the Reg Num (Sweden: Clearing number).   Can I add additional fields to the report? You can add up to 3 additional pay fields. Other fields are not supported at this time.   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate Fortnox with Planday. Are you looking for the Fortnox FAQ? See  Fortnox integration - FAQ and troubleshooting . Connect Planday with Fortnox to keep your information up to date in both systems and make managing data more manageable and time-efficient. You can manage and sync data with just a few clicks when the integration runs.   This guide will walk you through the steps needed to configure the connection between Planday and Fortnox, including connecting to a Fortnox account and mapping employee data across the systems. Connect your Fortnox account This will open a new view where you need to configure the integration. Activate the integration by pressing the toggle. In the Accounts section, press  Add , which will redirect you to Fortnox's login page, where you need to log in to your Fortnox account.   After logging in, you can review the requested permissions and authorise the connection to Planday. üí° You must have  sysadmin  rights in Fortnox to authorise the application. If you do not already have one, you must obtain a Fortnox integration license. (More information on the Fortnox pricing  page ). When the authorisation is successful, you'll be redirected back to Planday on the integration settings page. Open the Fortnox integration again by pressing  Manage . You should now see the account name you just connected listed in the  Accounts  section. With at least one Fortnox account connected, you can go on to match the employee data between Planday and Fortnox.   Create an employee data mapping For the integration to work as intended, you need to set up an employee mapping to ensure that the employee information in Planday matches their corresponding employee data entries in Fortnox. This is required to enable integration and guarantee that the data will be synced correctly between the two systems.   From the Fortnox integration settings page, in the  Employee data  section, press  Create mapping .   Next, select one of your connected  Fortnox accounts . If you have any employee records in Fortnox that do not yet exist in Planday, those can be created automatically. That is why the next step is to select a Department in Planday for the new employee data.  üí°  You can change an Employee's department later by going to  People  >  Employees  and clicking their name to edit their information. Verify employee data mapping Once the data is loaded, it will be displayed for you to verify and confirm or fix any inconsistencies before the mapping is created.   This list should contain the employee entries from Planday (with their salary identifier), their counterpart entry from Fortnox (with their employee ID), and the sync status between the two systems.   Matching existing employees Suggested matches: The automatically matched suggestions are marked by a blue link icon. Based on the employee's username (email address) in Planday and their email address in Fortnox. It can also be based on their ID when the Planday salary identifier matches their employee ID in Fortnox. Manual matches: Also marked by a blue link icon. For employees with data in both systems but for which the email or the salary identifier does not match, you can create a link from the  Add employees  button. Once added to the mapping their profiles match accordingly in the list, the blue link icon should show, confirming their status.  After you click  Add employees , you can switch between two lists of employee data entries, from Planday and Fortnox.  After selecting which employees to add to the mapping from the lists, click  Save . If no employees on the list need to be added or you don't have changes to make, click  Cancel  to return to the previous view. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è A red warning icon next to an employee entry means that information is missing from some fields. Please keep in mind to check that the Planday required fields for employee data are not empty when creating a mapping between Fortnox and Planday. You can check and configure the required property for the data field in  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup .   Importing employees Marked by a  green  icon.  If data for an employee only exists only in Planday or only in Fortnox, you'll also need to add them manually. Click the  + Add employees  button, select the employees available from either list and then press  Save . This will create a new employee entry in Planday or Fortnox.  Please note that different data fields may be required in each system, and those cannot be empty. If a required field is empty, a red warning icon will appear next to that employee‚Äôs name. This means that you will not only be able to create a new employee entry before all the required fields have relevant data. However, you would be able to map that employee to an already existing entry. You can read more about it in the  Fortnox FAQ article . üí° At any point during the process, you can check out the  Summary  box on the right-hand side. This shows the number of employees grouped by status and reflects what will happen when the integration is saved. If you hover over the info icon in the Summary box, you'll get a list of what information with be synced from Planday to Fortnox when updated in Planday. Once you match employee records from the two systems, you're ready to add the mapping to your integration. Press  Add to integration  button in the top right corner.   Editing or deleting employee mappings You can always change the mapping you created between the two systems by going to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview ,   finding the Fortnox Integration, and then clicking  Manage.   Under  Employee data , you'll find the existing mappings. Click anywhere on the row or hover over the row and select the  Edit  ( ‚úèÔ∏è ) icon.   Here, you can select a new default Department (within Planday) or continue to edit the existing mapping by clicking  Sync .  Similar to creating an employee mapping, you can fine-tune the individual employee mappings. You might notice a grey icon in the Status column when editing an employee data mapping. This indicates that the mapping for that employee has already been created. Additionally, some employees may have a  yellow  icon as their Status, representing that their profile has been deactivated in Planday. If you want to exclude employees from your existing mapping, you can remove them one by one from the  X  icon on their row. Once you're done with the necessary changes, click  Save .   If you want to  delete an employee mapping entirely  (or remove the mapping for all the mapped employees at once), click the Delete ( üóë ) icon by hovering over the name of the mapping.   Additional Employee data settings You'll notice two options turned on by default in the  Employee data  section. Here is what they do: Keep Fortnox up to date with employee data from Planday -  Synchronise the changes to employee data fields from Planday to Fortnox. (Changes are synced instantly to Fortnox.) Keep Planday up to date with the latest pay rates and monthly salaries from Fortnox -  Synchronize the hourly rates and fixed monthly salary rates from Fortnox to Planday  (daily sync at 03:00 am). Here, you can also see a quick overview of your existing mapping. This includes the Planday Department where the newly added employees will be created (if any) and a reference for how many employees have their data included in the mapping. When you've mapped employees and adjusted sync settings, you can move to the next step and set up payroll.   Next: Manage and sync payroll data to Fortnox   Need more help?

Here's what's new: Web:  Improvements to the Schedule page The schedule page received an update to improve the  visibility of bulk actions . Instead of icons, you now have buttons with text indicating the actions:  Edit ,  Approve ,  Set shifts to open , and  Delete .  When a Shift type does not allow for a break, the option to add a manual break to that shift has been removed from the schedule. This change clarifies what is sent to payroll regarding break data when marking shifts that do not require breaks. (For example, sickness, maternity or short shifts.) Improvements to the Schedule template editor It‚Äôs now possible to perform the following  bulk   actions on multiple shifts at once  in your templates: Edit shifts. Set shifts to open. Delete shifts.   Added the option to add comments to shifts in the Schedule template.  This means that schedule managers can prepare helpful information to go out to employees. Shift comments can now be added to the templates. Manager‚Äôs shift comments are copied when they save a schedule as a template. Lightened workload by not having to write comments on the shifts manually after applying the template.  Improved help messages when bulk-deleting shifts The confirmation messages are now updated to provide the exact information as to how many shifts out a total number of shifts were deleted and why some shifts could not be deleted. You now know which actions were taken and which could not be acted. Added option for notifying employees when deleting a whole week. Ability to change from Starter to Plus package You can now  change  your Planday subscription from a Starter to a Plus plan without waiting for processes to complete. If you are on a Starter package and want to upgrade, go to the Account section under your profile > switch to Plans > and press Upgrade under the Plus plan. Instantly access the Plus package's complete feature set, saving time and empowering you to  manage your plan changes  yourself. New payment method: ‚ÄúDirect debit‚Äù  will soon be available as a payment method for self-upgrade packages. This feature is being tested with customers in the UK and will be out to other markets soon. Edit carry-over settings on individual leave accounts (UK only) It is now possible to edit carry-over settings on individual Leave accounts (or Absence accounts) like on Leave templates. This setting is now available for admins in the UK and will be rolled out to other markets soon. Go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  > edit an account > and press  Edit  in front of the balance. This allows you to make the following changes to an employee's leave account: Enable/disable carry over. Edit the balance which can be carried over. Edit the date at which the carry-over balance expires. Time blocks added to the Data Center (Pro and Enterprise packages only) Addition of Time blocks option has been added to the Data Center. If the Data Centre is enabled, you can now create Metrics based on hourly data. Planday app:  Optimisations to shift request widget We changed the overview widget to show the count for up to three months‚Äô shift requests only, improving the app‚Äôs loading speed. The Shift requests data shown in the Requests screen is not affected by this improvement and will contain all the Shift requests.   Paid break information in Shift details  Employees can now see if their shift  break is paid or unpaid  from the Shift details page, giving them a better idea about the money they‚Äôll earn for the shift. This change is for both Android and iOS app. Optimised People feature for managers and employees is coming soon! To improve the user experience, we are introducing a UI change that enhances usability when browsing and editing employee information. We will move the  People  section under  More  >  Workplace  as part of this optimisation. Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 8.2.0 ) or iOS ( 8.2.0 ), updating to newer versions as they are released. Need more help?

Please contact Planday support team if you want to enable the Activation codes feature bypassing the IP addresses for your Web Punch Clock.   If you‚Äôd like to use the Punch Clock with a fixed IP address, see how to  add/update your IP address here.    What is a Punch Clock Activation code? A Punch Clock Activation code is a unique identifier that‚Äôs created once a device is activated with it. It is stored on the device itself.   Punch Clock Activation Codes enable you to set up access to  PunchClock.Planday.com  on specific devices on locations with  dynamic IP addresses  (fixed IP is not required).   This will enable you to set up a tablet of any kind or web browser with the  Web Punch Clock  interface, allowing your employees to punch in.    Please contact Planday support team if you want to enable the Activation codes feature bypassing the IP addresses for your Web Punch Clock. Once enabled, you will see the ability to generate activation codes for Punch Clock profiles. See below how to generate them. How can I set up a Punch Clock Activation code? ‚ö†Ô∏è  Before setting up your Activation codes, you must create one or more  Punch Clock profiles  on your Planday account. To set your device as a Punch Clock station, follow these steps: Go to  Settings  (1.) >  Punch Clock  >  Profiles  (2.) Hover your mouse on the right of your Punch Clock profile and click on the  Activation Code  icon (3.) Copy the Activation Code in the popup (4.) Open up  punchclock.planday.com/activate   on the device you want to set up and submit the code If the device has already been set up using an activation code, you‚Äôll be redirected to  punchclock.planday.com  for users to punch in. If the device has not been set up, you‚Äôll be redirected to  punchclock.planday.com/activate  to set up the device with an Activation Code.    The device is now set up, allowing employees to access Punch Clock via  PunchClock.Planday.com . üí°  Please note that when Punch Clock Activation Codes are used for multiple locations/Departments, the same validation method must be used for all locations, so  either  IP validation  or  Punch Clock Activation Codes validation. FAQs How can multiple devices be set up for the same department? To have multiple devices with the same department, you need to create multiple  Punch Clock profiles  (one Punch Clock profile = one device). Some of my Departments use a fixed IP address while others use a dynamic IP address. What do I do? When Punch Clock Activation Codes are used for multiple locations/Departments, the same validation method must be used for all locations, so  either  IP validation  or  Punch Clock Activation Codes validation. You would then need to use: either IP validation and  set different fixed IPs  for your Departments or Punch Clock Activation Codes validation and set all your Departments with one profile for each. What happens when a Punch Clock profile is deactivated? You need to reset the activation code by following the steps described in  How can I set up a Punch Clock Activation Code . I‚Äôm asked for an Activation Code when I log into  punchclock.planday.com . Why and where do I find this code? There could be several reasons to this: You recently added an  IP address  to use the Web Punch Clock and you previously used the activation code. You would need to wait between 10-15 minutes for the message to disappear. You can also try and clear your  cookies and caches . You accessed Web Punch Clock from a non-approved device.

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For advanced admins. If you‚Äôd like to see examples of Payroll supplements and how to use them, go to  Payroll Supplements ‚Äì Use Cases . You can create payroll supplements to automatically adjust employees‚Äô hourly rates or salaries based on set criteria. For example, you may want to pay your employees overtime if they work more than 10 hours during the day by using a  normal supplement . You may want to pay your employees double on certain holidays using a  day-based supplement . Or based on their  Contract type  some employees should be allocated a percentage of their hourly rate if they work on the weekends. How to create a Payroll supplement First, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement.   Here, you‚Äôll have the option to create different kinds of supplements.  If you click on the  Create  button under  Payroll supplement,  several options will be available from the drop-down menu:   1. Choose the type of supplement Supplement type : Normal Supplements, Week Based Supplement, Day Based Supplement and Contract rules supplement. Title : Name of the supplement. Description : Include a description (optional).   2. Define when the supplement should apply Based on the chosen Payroll supplement, different options will determine when should the supplement apply after how many hours at what time of the day and if it should be a monetary increase or a percentage increase. See  Payroll Supplements ‚Äì Use Cases  to learn more.    3. Define what days it should be applied and when it should be valid Days of the week : Select which days of the week the supplement should be applicable. Days from Bank Holiday calendar : Choose specific days from the  Bank Holiday calendar  in the system. Valid from/to : Set when the supplement comes into effect or ends.   4. Set filters defining who the supplement should apply to Employee groups : Select which  Employee groups  are eligible for the supplement. Employee types : Select which  Employee types  are eligible for the supplement. Shift types : This option allows you to define to which Shift types the Payroll supplement should apply. Contact our support team if you want to enable this option on your Planday.   5. Enable additional settings Affects salaried employees : If selected, the supplement will also affect those with a fixed salary rather than an hourly rate. This may not work with percentage-based supplements. Affected by breaks : If there is a break in the shift, should the break affect the shift time and therefore the total amount of time being affected by the supplement. Select this option if the supplement shouldn‚Äôt be paid during break periods. Enforced payment : Enable this to ensure that the supplement is always added to the pay ‚Äì even though other supplements are present in the same period of the shift. If you don't select this option and two supplements are applied to an employee at the same time, only the one with the highest value will be given. Allow over midnight : Select if a shift goes over midnight, potentially into a day not selected as being covered by a supplement, should the supplement continue to apply on the hours that fall in the next day after midnight. Overview of different Payroll supplements in Planday Normal supplement Normal supplements are used when an employee‚Äôs pay rate should be adjusted at a certain time of the day, or after a specified amount of hours into a shift. You can set the increase or decrease in pay rate based on a percentage of a wage, or as a set monetary value. For example, full-time employees should be paid an additional 50% of their normal wage after 8.5 hours of work. Week-based supplement Week-based supplements are used to apply a supplement after a set number of hours worked in a week. For example, you can create a week-based supplement that will apply an additional 50% of an employee‚Äôs normal wage after 40 hours have been worked in a single week. Day-based supplement Day-based supplements are used when employees work more than one shift per day. The day-based supplement will account for all hours worked during the day. For example, if an employee works more than 9 hours in a single day, they get time and a half for each hour worked over 9 hours. Manual supplement These supplements are used when you manually want to add supplements to your employees, such as bonuses. It applies directly to the shift in the schedule. You can set a fixed amount per shift or per hour.   Contract rules supplement A Contract rules supplement can be applied to all employees that have a specific contract rule to pay them automatically any overtime supplements. For this type of supplement to work, you should already have  contract rules set up  for different employee types under  Settings  >  Contract rules  >  Create Contract rule.  This governs how many hours an employee should be working and lets you see and compare if they go beyond the contracted hours in the schedule and pay them a supplement.   Personal supplement You can set a fixed amount that your employees can get on a monthly basis.  For example, an employee receives a bonus for being a team leader in a busy period. Seniority supplement Seniority supplements can be added to the original pay rate, either monthly, bimonthly, daily or hourly after a certain length of employment. You can set up a required employment length and the number of days the supplement should be added. Time supplement This is especially relevant for employees who work on bank holidays.  For example, employees can get a time supplement of 150% or 200% on bank holidays. This time compensation is added to their TOIL (Overtime) account. Ifthe option  % (overtime)  is used in the dropdown under Hourly wage when you create a Normal supplement, the Time supplement will show in the section Time supplement.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For experienced admins.  Assign a salary to your employees  first. Enable payroll costs in the schedule You can view the payroll hours and costs of your salaried and waged employees in the schedule to help you to plan your shifts effectively.    üí°  You can activate the settings for payroll costs to appear on the schedule by going to  Schedule  >  View settings  > and activating  Payroll hours & costs. If you pay employees a fixed salary instead of wages, you have various options for calculating the salary costs in the schedule. In this article, you will learn about those calculation methods and can decide which method to use.   To assign a fixed salary to an employee, see the article  How to set an employee's fixed salary . Select an employee >  Edit  >  Employment  >  Salary  >  Edit salary . In the top section of the edit window - Payroll information - you should see the data entered for your employee's salary:   If salary data has been added, go to the next section  Payroll costs in Schedule. üí° Remember that the cost allocation and payroll are different. Salary will be reflected in the payroll as a set amount regardless of how you allocate the cost in the schedule. Calculate payroll costs based on Salary amount In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Salary amount .   You can see a direct calculation of this in the lower section, Estimated costs per hour. Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary amount is divided by the number of shift hours in the schedule for the current salary period. When entered in the rota, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works that day. Example: An employee is paid a fixed salary of ¬£2000. The estimated cost per hour - ¬£26.67 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of shift hours in the schedule - in this case, 75. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift in the schedule is given as ¬£160.02 (6*¬£26.67). üí°  The  Payroll start day  is the day of the month from which each salary calculation will begin. This value can't be set as a higher number because the month of February has 28 days (with the exception of leap years). Calculate payroll costs based on Scheduled hours In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Scheduled hours .   You can see a direct calculation in the lower section  Estimated hourly cost . Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary is divided by the expected working hours in the Schedule. When entered in the schedule, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works on that day. The total cost may therefore differ from the fixed salary, depending on how many hours are assigned to the employee. The actual salary cost will not change for Payroll even if the cost on the Schedule is higher/lower.   Example: An employee receives a fixed salary sum of ¬£2.000 and is supposed to work 60 hours per month according to their contract. The estimated cost per hour - ¬£33.33 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the expected hours worked. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift is indicated in the schedule as 200.00¬£ (6 * ¬£33.33). Calculate payroll costs based on Business days In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Bussiness days . For  Business days , select the days of the week to be included in the calculation.  For  Show in Schedule for , select the department in which to display the salary costs. In the lower area,  Estimated daily cost , you can see a direct calculation. Optional: You can change the day of the month from which the salary is calculated at  Show cost calculation each month, starting from . Confirm your selection by pressing  Save . The estimated daily cost is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of opening days in the  Pay period  (by default: Monthly). The estimated daily cost may vary from month to month, depending on the business days in the period.   Don‚Äôt show (default) By default, the option  Don't show  is set. This means that the fixed salary is not taken into account when calculating the total payroll costs on the schedule. However, it remains added for the Payroll export data.   Need more help?

The  pay period  determines how often the employee will be paid both hourly and fixed salaries.   You can set a pay period for each employee by going to  People  >  Edit employee  >  Employment  >  Pay periods . The default pay period is  Monthly , which is pre-selected for all your employees unless you change it.   When processing your payroll from  Payroll  >  Payroll export , you can select which pay periods to include in your report.   Which pay period should you set? You probably already have a pay period that works for your business and your region‚Äôs market requirements. Besides the default  Monthly  option, Employees may prefer to be paid more frequently on a  weekly  or  fortnightly  schedule giving them quick budgeting possibilities. However, it can be time-consuming to have to run payroll at a more frequent interval if you have many employees.   You have the following options to choose from when setting a pay period: Monthly  - (default) - Employees get their hourly salary calculated for the month or earn a fixed income. This option is suitable for fixed-salaried employees. Fortnightly  - also known as  bi-weekly  or  every other week pay period . Employees get their hourly salary calculated for two weeks. This option is suitable for hourly paid employees. Weekly  - You can use this to pay your hourly or fixed-salaried employees on a weekly basis. Four-weekly  - You can choose this option if you pay your employees after four weeks (as opposed to every calendar month). This option is suitable for hourly paid employees. How to set or change an employee‚Äôs pay period? While choosing a pay period when starting a new business may be easy, changing to a new period for existing employees can also be accomplished very quickly. You can change an employee‚Äôs pay period by navigating to  People  >  Employees  > click the name of the employee and press  Edit  > go to  Employment  tab > scroll down to the  Pay period  section. üí° When changing a pay period, you must specify when that pay period should come into effect. Set this by selecting a future date under  Valid from.  The change will go into effect from 00:00 of the selected day.   How to set or change an employee‚Äôs Salary?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For administrators with legacy Planday accounts. Most legacy Planday accounts have only male and female options when choosing gender in the  employee setup form . By default, this is a required field that you, as an admin, must fill out, and your employee can choose.   Through consensus, we have reached a solution that gives you and your employees control while keeping the current setup for clients who need this field mandatory. Here is how you can change it for your Planday setup with a few easy steps.   How to archive the current gender field Start by going to your Employee field setup form via  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup . Press the  Archive field  button on the row of the existing Gender field.   Once archived, the field will be moved to the  Archived fields  section at the bottom of the employee form, and the legacy choice is no longer visible on the employee create or edit form nor on the employee profile settings. How to create custom gender field options Under the  Misc section , press the  Add field  link and set Type to  dropdown . As an admin, this allows you to add a custom selection of gender choices for the employees to pick from. Alternatively, you can set the Type to  text , allowing employees to write how they wish to identify.   Under  Access levels , set the permissions to allow you and the employee to edit this field when creating or editing their profile.  You can also set if this is a required field to fill or optional.   Depending on what you set up, the employee can now go into their profile via the web or Planday app and identify their choice of gender.   FAQ's Can I add additional genders to the existing gender field instead of archiving it? No. If you want your employee form to support additional gender options, you can create a custom field as a dropdown with a defined set of options. Or you can add a text option to let your employees write how they wish to identify. If you add a custom gender selection in your employee form, archive the legacy gender field and replace it with your custom field. Are any integrations affected by removing the gender field? Some legacy payroll integrations may require mapping employees to a fixed gender field. Please check the syncing requirements of your integration if you work with a service that requires a gender field to be present when sending employee data. This will help ensure that the necessary data is transmitted correctly and that all relevant fields are included in the integration process. Can the newly created gender field be put back in the Information section? When you archive the old gender field, a new custom field can only be created in a section such as Miscellaneous or Payroll.  Need more help?

Additional payroll costs are used to get a realistic overview of your actual employment costs by factoring in payroll elements that can add to the total scheduled cost of an employee.   For example, additional payroll costs can be used to forecast holiday accrual costs (through an additional payroll cost of 12.07%) or pension (as an additional payroll cost of 3-4%).   To start, go to  Settings  >  Reports  >  Revenue  and  Additional payroll costs . Click  Create  and you can start to set up an additional payroll cost as a percentage.   The  Create additional payroll costs  editing window appears where you can set the following options:   Title:  Name the additional payroll cost, so you can find it later if needed. Additional payroll costs:  Add in the percentage you would like to inflate the rate by (the percentage you'd like to simulate the costs with). Wage type:  Choose which method of payment you would like to inflate. This can be Schedule costs, such as hourly rates (hourly wage), Shift rates (wage per shift), or salaries (fixed salary). Employee type:  Choose a specific employee type that this rule will affect.  By default, the additional payroll cost will apply to  All  employee types.  üí° If you need to change that, you'll have to save your changes first and then reopen the payroll cost details page, from the ‚úèÔ∏è icon, to edit it.  Description : Optionally, you can write a note to describe the additional cost. Example: Application of the additional payroll costs on the schedule Additional payroll costs will affect both the costs on the schedule and the revenue report. Please keep in mind that as this addition only takes place for scheduled costs (as a simulation), these rules will not change the payroll costs. This can be useful when checking the Revenue bar on the Schedule page. Here is the Revenue bar, with both revenue and payroll costs displayed, before adding a simple 10% additional payroll cost: And here is the same bar, with the 10% rule attached: As you can see, by adding the additional cost, a schedule that looks under budget would come in over budget when the scheduled costs more accurately represent the actual cost of employment.

Once complete, your employees can clock in and out from Tevalis, and their clock entries will appear directly in Planday's Punch Clock. Clock times with a start and end time are automatically fetched by Planday every 5 min for the past 48 hours.    Clock times will be visible directly on the shift or inside the Punch Clock menu in  Schedule  >  Punch Clock . If there is a note attached in Tevalis, it will appear as a comment in Planday with the header: Tevalis integration.   Preparing the integration Centralised users The integration requires that you use Centralised users in Tevalis so that users can be mapped between the systems. This means that your users must be managed in the centralised manager application in Tevalis. This is a prerequisite to identifying the user's clock entries from Tevalis and matching them to the correct shifts in Planday.   After the integration is launched your employees will be managed in Planday and their details exported to Tevalis. The following information will be exported: First name Last name Employee group   Request details from Tevalis Before you can set up the integration, contact Tevalis support to request the following details: Your Tevalis Company ID Your Tevalis Secret Your Tevalis Secret 2 If you are not provided with two different secrets, please make a request to Tevalis support to have their API team create the Tevalis Secret 2.   The next step is to verify that existing users have identical names in both Tevalis and Planday.   If you are already a Planday and Tevalis customer and have your users created in both systems, you need to make an initial sync of existing employees. This will provide the users in Tevalis with an external ID from Planday, so Planday can recognise the users in Tevalis.     Activate the Tevalis integration Connect to Tevalis üí° If you have several Planday organizations, you can only connect one Tevalis account to one Planday organization. Connecting the same Tevalis account to different Planday organisations will disconnect it.   Log into Planday and go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview . Find the Tevalis integration in the Time & Attendance category and select  Add . Enter the company ID and both of the secrets which you received from Tevalis support. Press  connect . If the connection fails, please check that you have entered the correct connection details from Tevalis. Next, turn on Push employee data and Tevalis Time Clock   Export of existing employees If you already have users in Planday and Tevalis you can make an initial mapping of these users with the following steps.   On the integrations, page open the Tevalis Time & Attendance integration with the Manage button. Next, select Show details and you will see a list of your employees. Select each Employee group that you want sent to Tevalis. Please note that the Planday Employee groups will overwrite existing groups in Tevalis. Finally, select the Push now button to export the users to Tevalis. Users that already exist in Tevalis will be updated with the Employee group and external ID. Employees that do not yet exist in Tevalis will be created.   New employees Going forward, new employees only need to be created in Planday. Then, instead of also creating the same user in Tevalis, you will simply go to the Tevalis Time and Attendance integration on the integrations page in Planday and select the Employee group the new employee is in. Here you can use the Push now button to add them to Tevalis.     Start using the time clock integration Importing Tevalis clock times Now that the integration is connected and your employees are mapped between Planday and Tevalis the integration will start importing clock times from Tevalis. Time clock entries will be imported every 5 minutes for the past 48 hours. Please note that only time clock entries with both a clock in and a clock out time in Tevalis are imported.   Automatic breaks set up in Planday will be applied to shifts with time clock entries imported from Tevalis. Please note:  Manual breaks in Planday will not work with this integration. Please note:  Clock in and out in Tevalis for breaks will not work with this integration. Planday  rounding rules  will be applied to the imported time clock entries from Tevalis when they are matched to a shift in Planday.    How time clock entries from Tevalis are matched to shifts in Planday If you are curious to understand how time clock entries are matched to the specific shifts in Planday, you can review the set of rules that determines this below.   If an employee has 1 shift on a day, the time clock entries are matched to the shift regardless of the difference between the clock times and shift times. If an employee has 2 consecutive shifts on a day (e.g. 8-14 + 14-17) the integration will match both shifts by following: Shift 1: Time in ‚Äì 14 Shift 2: 14 ‚Äì Time out If an employee has 2 non-consecutive shifts on a day, the integration will work as below: If both the clock in/out times have a difference of less than 1 hour, it will match the shifts. If punch in exceeds a 1-hour difference and punch out has less than a 1-hour difference for the shift times, it will match the shift. If the clock in has less than a 1-hour difference and the clock out has more than a 1-hour difference from the shift times, it will match. If both punch in and punch out times exceed an hour difference from shift times, it will NOT match to any shifts. In this case, no time clock entry is imported, and you will have to verify the punch times with the employee and manually update the times in Planday. You're now ready to start using the integration so you can approve shifts when your employees' time clock information from Tevalis arrives in Planday!   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents Punch Clock deviation rules can help you automate some administrative tasks for shifts that differ from their scheduled punch times. Once you have configured the rules, Planday keeps track of your employee's hours and the changes between their actual and scheduled hours. The deviations will show as suggestions along the rest of the shift in the  Punch Clock approval  to be approved by an admin or schedule manager.   With deviation rules, you can configure Planday to automatically: differentiate the hours worked before or after the scheduled hours. track and calculate the average of the deviations in working hours, for each employee, over time. calculate the effect on salary at the end of a salary period for each employee. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Note that using  Rounding rules  in your Punch Clock may conflict with applying deviation rules. You may need to turn them off or configure Rounding rules to start only with carefully calculated durations. How to create a deviation rule To begin with, create a deviation rule by going to   Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Deviations from scheduled time  >  Create Configure a deviation type After pressing  Create , you can choose which scenarios you want to track and what to happen when the selected scenario occurs. You can make changes later if the initial setup does not suit your scheduling needs.   Name  - This will be used as the name in the deviation rules list.   Deviation type  -   The different deviation types describe different scenarios where you can define what should happen when the scenario occurs. Below you can read more about what the different types are used for. Arrives early  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between punching in before and the scheduled start time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching in happens at 9:30 am, rules of this type will affect the time from 9:30 am to 10 am. Arrives late  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between the scheduled start time and punching in later than the planned time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching in happens at 10:30 am, rules of this type will affect the time from 10 am to 10:30 am. Leaves early  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between punching out and the scheduled end time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching out happens at 5:30 pm, rules of this type will affect the time from 5:30 pm to 6 pm. Leaves late  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between the scheduled end time and punching out. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching out happens at 6:30 pm, rules of this type will affect the time from 6 pm to 6:30 pm. Shift length not reached  determines what should happen when an employee hasn‚Äôt been at work long enough on a given day. The timesheet must have a start and end time to calculate the shift length for this type. This type matches if the punch time length is less than the actual shift length.  This type is not affected by the placement of the shift and the Punch Clock entry. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4 pm, the employee has been working for the correct 8 hours and rules of this type will not generate any deviations. On the other hand, if the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 3:30 pm, 30 minutes of work is missing and rules of this type will generate a deviation from 3:30 pm to 4 pm. Shift length exceeded  is used to determine what should happen when an employee has been at work for too long on a given day. For this type, the shift must have a start and end time to calculate the shift length. This type matches if the punch time length is greater than the actual shift length.  This type is not affected by the placement of the shift and the punch time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4 pm, the employee has been working for the correct 8 hours and rules of this type will not generate any deviations. On the other hand, if the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4:30 pm, the employee has been working 30 minutes extra and rules of this type will generate a deviation from 4 pm to 4:30 pm. üí°  Note that rules concerning  shift length  always have the  highest priority  compared to other types. When a rule related to the shift length has been matched with a shift, all other rules will be ignored for this shift. Final shift type  - Defines the  Shift type  that will be applied to the new shift made by the deviation. For example, if an employee stamps out too late, it can generate overtime according to a deviation rule. See the example below for this use case. Minimum length  - Defines the minimum number of minutes the deviation must be before this rule processes it. 0 means that the rule affects all deviations. Start of shift  - Defines from where in a deviation this rule should start, as time in minutes. 0 means that the rule should apply to the whole deviation. Length  - Defines how long a deviation of this rule should be treated as time in minutes. 60 would mean 1hr.  Depending on your requirements, you can limit your Deviation rules to only apply under certain conditions. You can set them using the following settings. By default, the rule applies to  All  shifts and employees. Shift types  - Apply the rule only to specific  Shift types .  Departments  - Apply the deviation rule only to certain  Departments . Employee groups  - Limit the deviation to only certain groups of employees by selecting an  Employee group . Employee types  - Apply the rule only to some  Employee types . Remember to press  Save  and continue the same process for all desired Deviation rules you create. Example of a shift length exceeded deviation rule  To show how deviation rules work in practice, here is an example with the type  Shift length exceeded .   First, the rule is created by going to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Deviations from scheduled time  >  Create .    This deviation type is used when you want to specify what should happen when an employee has been at work for too long. You want to count his hours towards an overtime account by applying a Shift type, a final shift type is chosen here that provides overtime, ie. ‚Äú+‚Äù, On the Time Off Account.    In this example, the  Shift type   Flex + (100% ) is applied and it is set to generate overtime as defined under  Settings  >  Absence  >  General .   The  Minimum length  is set to 15. This is the minimum number of minutes the shift must be exceeded before the rule takes effect.   The  length  is set to 120 minutes which indicates that the rule is valid for up to 2 hours.   Example shift with deviation rule applied in Punch Clock & Schedule In the following example, the employee has a shift from 16:00-21:00. He stamps in 30 minutes before the start of the shift and stamps out 35 minutes after the end time of the shift. This gives a total of 1 hour and 5 minutes affected by the above deviation rule. Under  Schedule  >  Punch Clock,  you can see how the shift is divided up if the deviation rule is used. The first 5 hours have the shift type Normal and the remaining time of 1.05 hours has automatically been given the shift type Overtime (Flex +). According to the setup, this type of shift will generate additional time for the timeoff account if an administrator approves the deviation. In the Punch Clock overview, the shift before approval will look like this where 5 hours are considered as normal scheduled hours and the extra 1.05 hours are split and counted as overtime. On the  Punch Clock approval  page, you can choose whether you want to use the deviation rule by selecting between Yes or No before approving the hours for pay. When the shift is approved, you can see the division in the shift schedule as shown below: Need more help?   Please search for answers in the üîç  Help Center  or watch our ‚ñ∂Ô∏è  video tutorials .

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins. Get to know the  structure of Planday here . What is a Shift type? Shift types  mark non-regular Shifts on the schedule. For example, a Shift type can be set up for marking trial Shifts or illnesses on the Schedule.    This opens up a wide range of options for you when using the Planday schedule to document variations in Shifts and use them for reporting or payroll. In this article, you'll learn how to create Shift types and what you can use them for. How to create a Shift type To do this, navigate to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types . Click on  Create  to generate new Shift types.   If there are some pre-generated Shift types or you have already created some, you can see and edit them here.    When the  Create Shift type  window opens, you can set the following details to define your Shift type.   In the example, a fictitious Shift type 'Sickness covered' is created.   Name  - The name is visible to all users with access to the Schedule. Salary code  - Learn more about Salary codes in the article  How to set up Salary codes . You can use Salary codes to make your payroll clearer, or if necessary, use them with external payroll integrations. Leave this field blank if it is not relevant to you. üí° Please note that depending on the setup of your payroll system, you might want to set up  Payroll supplements  in order to match your  Salary codes  correctly. Colour  - A colour code can make it easier to recognise the Shift type on the Schedule and when pulling/exporting  Shift type statistics reports . Rate adjustment -  Define how the Shift type should affect pay. To pay the full wage when the shift type is applied, leave the value at 100 per cent.  If no payment is to be paid, e.g. for unpaid absence, enter 0 Percent.  For hours that should be paid at a higher rate than normal, enter a value greater than 100 per cent, for example, 150 per cent for 1.5 times pay for weekend shifts. Optionally, instead of percentages, after selecting from the drop-down list, you can also enter an  amount that replaces existing rate  or an  amount that is added to existing rate  in the local currency of your Planday organisation. Description  - Leave a description for internal understanding, especially if several  Schedule managers  work with Shift types. The description is only visible when editing the Shift type.   Additional settings  Allow conflicting shifts  - If you leave this unchecked, you'll receive a warning in the Schedule if you try to schedule the same employee for two shifts simultaneously. If you have circumstances that require registering an employee for multiple shifts simultaneously, enable this option. Allow booking  - Checking this box will allow the Shift type to be booked when set to  Open, sold, or available to swap . This should typically remain disabled for Shift types used to register sick leave, training, or staff meetings. Overwrite when applying a template  - A Shift type with this option enabled will be overwritten when you apply a  Schedule template . Uncheck the option for Shift types used to plan future events like staff meetings. Include in Schedule print  - If you print or download your schedule, check this box to include the Shift type. Include in Schedule message  - When sending messages to employees on the Schedule for a specific day, the Shift type will be included. This option should typically be disabled for Shift types used to register sick leave. Count hours in payroll report  - Disable this option for Shift types that don't need to be included in the total of worked hours in the payroll report. For most Shift types this option is enabled.   Payroll supplements  - Check this box if you want hours from this Shift type to be affected by  Payroll supplements . Break  - Check this box if you want breaks to apply for this Shift type. Read more about  setting up and working with breaks . Meal contribution  - Check this box if you want meal contribution and deduction to apply for this Shift type. Meal contributions and deductions can be set up by going to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Meal contribution and deduction . Affects fixed salaried : Enable this option if this Shift type should apply to fixed salaried employees. Confirm by clicking  Save . You can change the settings later by editing the Shift type. üí°  Please note: When creating a new Shift type, check whether it should be linked to an existing  Contract rule . This will ensure the completeness of the contract term as all relevant Shift types will be included. Learn more in the article on  creating and applying Contract rules . How to change a Shift type of a shift on the schedule You can manually change the Shift type of a shift on the schedule. You have several options to do this: Click on the three dots on the shift and select  Apply shift type . Then choose from the list. (see screenshot) Click on a shift and edit it, select a new Shift type from the drop-down list under  Shift type  and confirm via  Save . When editing several shifts simultaneously, you can apply a Shift type to all selected shifts.  Statistics on Shift type usage If you use Shift types, you can view insightful reports: View sickness absence, trial hours, punctuality, overtime or other Shift types you have set up. To do this, navigate to  Reports  >  Shift type  s tatistics . Find out all the details in the article  Using Shift types for reporting and payroll . Use Shift types to record overtime (TOIL) hours One of the methods for recording  overtime  is based on using Shift types that you can set up for overtime or undertime hours. In practice, minus or overtime hours are transferred to your employees' overtime accounts as soon as the corresponding Shift type is applied to one of their shifts.   To learn more about this method and compare it with other ways of overtime management, take a look at the article  How is TOIL handled with Shift types .   Set pay rates using Shift types Shift types can be applied to any employee on a per-shift basis to make payroll adjustments such as unpaid leave or manual overtime pay.    Example of shift type to set an extra allowance  In the example shown above, a  Shift type  is created for employees who work overtime and should be paid 50% on top of their normal wage (1). Additional settings (2): The option to  Allow conflicting shifts  has been enabled in this example, as the Shift type may only apply to part of a shift for an employee. The  Allow booking  option is disabled since a shift with this Shift type applied to it should not be swapped or set to open. The option  Overwrite when applying a template  is deselected to prevent a template from overwriting the Shift type.

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series) with Planday. This integration is only available for customers based in the UK, Germany, the USA and France. With Planday, you can connect your Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series - formerly iKentoo) POS system and automatically import sales data. This lets you compare your revenue vs payroll costs and helps you plan your schedules to align with the budget. You can connect different K-Series Business Locations with Planday Revenue units. Follow this setup guide to configure the integration. Requirements for the integration For this integration to work, you must complete two prerequisites in Planday.     1. Set up Revenue units in Planday To get this integration working, you must map Planday‚Äôs Revenue units with Lightspeed‚Äôs Registers/Outlets to fetch revenue data.   Before setting up the integration, create at least one  Revenue unit  in every  Department  where you wish to import revenue.  To set up a Revenue unit in Planday, go to  Settings  > under the  Reports  heading, press  Revenue  >  Create. üí° You can create several revenue units within a department   When setting up a Revenue unit, select the option to  Enter daily revenue  for every unit you want to map, along with selecting  Include in total revenue,  as shown in the screenshot below.   üí°  For detailed steps, read the  Revenue in Planday  article.     2. Create Shifts on business days where revenue should be imported Revenue can only be imported into the business days of your schedule. To create a business day in your schedule, ensure that there is at least one  Shift  for the given day where you wish to import revenue.  Set up the integration in Planday Follow these steps to find, connect and configure the integration.    Find and connect the integration Once the prerequisites have been completed, go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview.  Switch to the  Point of Sale  tab to see all available POS integrations or search for the integration name from the search bar.      Click  Connect  on the  Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series)  tile to start setting up the integration.   Connect Lightspeed account Connect one or more Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series)  Accounts  by pressing the  Connect account  button. This will redirect you to a Lightspeed sign-in page. You must enter your email and password here. After signing in, you will then be redirected back to Planday in  Settings > Integrations > Overview . Locate the Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series) and click on  Connect  again. The green  status  icon üü¢ will inform you that the connection is set up correctly.  üí°  In case of issues with the connection, a dedicated status message and light will be displayed in front of the account. You can click on the status to read more or take further action if required. Configure data import settings When at least one account is connected successfully, complete the integration setup by specifying other settings and mappings.  Overwrite existing data -  Select this option if the integration should overwrite the existing figures in Planday. This should be selected if the budgeted revenue is entered manually in the revenue report, or if the days being fetched have had any changes or updates made to the revenue figures in Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series). Import revenue data  Incl. tax / Excl. tax : Select whether or not you want to include or exclude VAT in the revenue imported from Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series). Incl. Service charge / Excl. Service charge : Choose whether or not you want to include or exclude the service charge you‚Äôve set up in Lightspeed.   üí° The product type ‚Äúservice charge‚Äù (usually 12.5% of the revenue corresponding to the tips) will need to be created  in Lightspeed first. Link Planday Revenue units with Lightspeed Business Locations üí°  At least  one Revenue unit in Planday  is required for this step. Over to the right, you should see an overview of the Revenue units created for your business in Planday. In the dropdown next to the name of each Revenue unit, choose the corresponding Business Locations in Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series), so that the revenue from the selected business locations is imported into the correct departments in Planday in order to calculate accurate labour percentages.    üí° It‚Äôs a good idea to have a one-to-one mapping between Business Locations (sales areas) and revenue units so you can quickly review individual revenue numbers.   Activate the integration Lastly, select  Activate  at the bottom of your screen. Now the integration will start importing your revenue data into the corresponding revenue units automatically from Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series). Import historical revenue on-demand (optional) The integration to Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series) allows you to import your daily revenue data from up to 30 days back in time. You would want to do this, for example, to view revenue compared to labour costs in Planday for the entire payroll period that you are currently in. This step is optional. The integration will start pulling data from Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series)  every 5 minutes  from the date on which you activated the integration. You can also check back anytime if you wish to use the on-demand import function at a later date. üí°  Before you start make sure you have completed the mapping of your Planday revenue units to your Business locations in Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series) and have activated the integration. To do an import of historical revenue, follow the steps below.  In  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview , find the Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series) integration and select  Manage Under the section  Import historical revenue , select the number of days in the past you wish to fetch daily revenue data from and select Import. You will see a progress bar while your revenue is being imported from Lightspeed Restaurant (K-Series). Please wait. When the import is complete you will see a prompt below the Import button indicating that the revenue was successfully imported.  4. Click  Save  to exit   See the imported values To verify in Planday : Open the Schedule page on Planday. Press the  View settings  button, and turn on the Revenue toggle to reveal earnings values at the bottom of each business day. Revenue imported for a given Revenue unit is displayed in the Daily revenue pop-up.   Or you can go to  Reports  >  Revenue > Per day  in the top menu and click on the daily revenue link where the same daily revenue pop-up will show. üí°  You can check the source of the revenue data in the  Notes  of the Daily Revenue   üí°  Be aware that the Notes field contains the timestamp of the revenue import and a label of the revenue source. The shown timestamp reflects the UCT time zone and is not adjusted for your Planday organisation‚Äôs location. To Verify in Lightspeed : The data in K-Series can be checked from your Lightspeed dashboard under  Reports > Transactions.   Revenue import details Integration timing The integration imports revenue data from Lightspeed every 5 minutes. Include or exclude tax values By default, the integration imports Gross values from mapped locations. To import Net values, uncheck the  Incl. tax  option. Revenue value The imported revenue is the sum of the revenue values of all active Business Locations mapped to the Revenue unit from successfully connected Lightspeed accounts. If any Lightspeed account connection does not work, revenue from the Account‚Äôs Business Locations will not count in the revenue imported into the mapped Revenue units. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Note that incomplete revenue values will overwrite correct values imported in the past if a Lightspeed account connection stops working and if you are importing values for several days in the past. FAQs and troubleshooting How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, you can remove individual connected Lightspeed accounts by clicking on  Manage  on the integration‚Äôs tile, and then on  Disconnect . This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be overwritten. Alternatively, from the same window, click on  Deactivate . Revenue is not importing Ensure that there is at least one Shift on the Schedule for each day where revenue should be imported.  Ensure that the Enter daily revenue checkbox, located in  Settings > Revenue , is selected for mapped revenue units.  Verify that Lightspeed Restaurant K-Series Business Locations are mapped to the Revenue units of the relevant Departments.   The account needs to be reconnected In some instances, authorisation to the connected account can fail, and the account will need to be reconnected. You can see the current status of the connected accounts displayed next to the corresponding account when you open the integration tile. To reconnect the account, you must click on the  Manage  button in the Integration tile and then on  Disconnect .  Click on the  Connect Account  button and a pop-up window asking you to sign in again will appear. Once you sign in, the connection status will be updated. ‚ö†Ô∏è  When an account needs to be reconnected, its revenue will not be imported into Planday, meaning that you might notice unusually low revenue shown in the Schedule. To remedy this, click on the  Import now  button in the Import historical revenue section in the Lightspeed K-Series integration settings. Can I connect several Lightspeed accounts to the same Planday organisation? Yes, it's possible. To add another Lightspeed account to your Planday,  go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  find the relevant Lightspeed integration tile and click on  Connect click on  Connect account  and add the details of that second connection Then, you can link the relevant revenue units ( corresponding to the departments) to the relevant Business locations.

Find QuickBooks Online and select Add to set it up.     Connect to your QuickBooks Online account Start setting up the integration by selecting Connect to QuickBooks. This will redirect you to QuickBooks Online, where you will need to authorise the integration. If you are already logged into QuickBooks Online, you can go ahead and authorise the integration to Planday. If you are not logged in, you must first log in to QuickBooks to authorise access to Planday. Once you have authorised access, you will be redirected back to the Planday integration page. Select the Add button on the QuickBooks Online tile to verify the systems are successfully connected. From there, toggle on the features which should be available for the integration (Employee details and/or Worked hours).   Select Activate to launch the integration of QuickBooks Online and Planday.     Synchronise existing employees Once the integration is activated using the above steps, you can synchronise your existing employees between Planday and QuickBooks Online.   Prepare the employee synchronisation An important step is to revise one of QuickBooks Online's settings to prevent all inactive employees in QuickBooks Online from being exported to Planday. To do this, log in to QuickBooks Online and edit an inactive employee, then deselect the option Show in non-payroll list in the Employment section. This step should be carried out for each inactive employee. Next, enter employee address information in Planday.   When QuickBooks Payroll is enabled on your QuickBooks Online account, ensure that the fields City, Postal Code, and State are entered for every employee. If this information is not entered, the employee will not be exported to QuickBooks Online when you activate the integration.     Synchronise existing employees On the QuickBooks Online integration tile in Planday, select Manage, then select Show details under the Employee details section. Select which department employees imported from QuickBooks Online should be assigned to. When a new employee is created in Planday, you can edit the employee and modify which Departments they are in. Before synchronising your employees, ensure their names and emails are identical in both systems to avoid creating duplicates. Lastly, select Sync Employees Now. The integration will now update and link employees across QuickBooks Online and Planday. Create new employees With the integration setup, you can create new users or employees in either system and they will automatically be synchronised to the other.     Create new employees in Planday When you create new employees in Planday they will automatically be created in QuickBooks Online with the following details: Given name Family name E-mail Mobile / Primary phone Address (city, postal code and state is required when QuickBooks Payroll is enabled) Birthdate Gender Hired date ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note:  Contact info public  needs to be ticked in Planday for employees to be automatically created in QuickBooks Online. See the article on  Employee information: visibility and access settings .   Create new employees in QuickBooks Online You can also create new employees in QuickBooks Online and they will automatically be created in Planday. They will be created in Planday with the same details as above.   Creating employees from QuickBooks Online requires that you have selected a default Planday department that new employees will be assigned to. To do so go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  >  QuickBooks Online  >  Employee details  >  Show details  >  Select department . When creating employees from QuickBooks Online please be aware that there is a 5 min processing time, before the employee will be exported from QuickBooks Online.     Send Welcome notification When employees are created from QuickBooks Online you can have Planday send them a welcome notification that contains the relevant Planday info. To do so, go to  People  >  Employees  > Select employee > Click on the  Invite employee icon .     Export worked hours Prepare the automatic export of worked hours To automatically export worked hours from Planday to QuickBooks, toggle on Export Worked Hours in the QuickBooks Online integration configuration via  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  >  QuickBooks Online  >  Worked Hours  >  Export Worked Hour s. The integration will send all worked hours from normal shifts by default. If you also want hours from a specific Shift type to be exported to QuickBooks Online, you can select the relevant Shift types in the QuickBooks Online integration configuration. To do so, go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  >  QuickBooks Online  >  Worked Hours  >  Show details  >  Add shift types .     Export worked hours When a shift in Planday is approved, the worked hours will automatically be exported to QuickBooks Online as a time activity.   The integration supports Break rules in Planday, and only the worked hours will be exported (break times will not be exported).   Unapprove or delete shifts If a shift is already approved and the worked hours have been exported to QuickBooks Online, you can remove the worked hours from QuickBooks Online by marking the shift as Not approved in Planday, or by deleting the shift in Planday. After doing this, the integration will automatically remove the time activity from the weekly timesheet in QuickBooks Online.   Syncing leave data with QuickBooks Planday integration with QuickBooks does not directly support synchronising of leave as a feature. You can get around this by transferring leave data by utilising Shift types on your schedule. For guidance, please see this article on  How to use absence with payroll integration . Need more help?

Sync employee data This step will enable employee data synchronisation between Planday and Xero. Assuming you have already created employees in either system, this first-time synchronisation will let you combine data from both platforms so any changes in one are reflected in the other. Any subsequent changes to employee data in Planday would be reflected in Xero but not the other way around. The values we sync from Planday to Xero are: First name and Last name E-mail address Birthday Gender Address City Postcode Country ‚ö†Ô∏è  For the sync to be successful, all the fields must be filled in in Planday.

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For Planday admins using Xero in the UK. See  Xero Setup instructions here .   Integration setup My organisation is not connected successfully If you have the following message: ‚ÄúYou do not have sufficient payroll permissions‚Äù, it can be caused by two things: You need to ensure that the user who connected the organisation has payroll permissions in Xero and has not been deactivated. It can also be because the Payroll module of your organisation is not set up yet. To fix this, open  Xero.com , navigate to your Xero organisation and click  Payroll > Overview . Visiting this page will initialise the Payroll module and the next time you open the Xero integration in Planday, the status should be updated.   Employee syncing What information is required to add an employee in Planday and Xero? Ensure that the fields listed below are filled in the employee profile in Planday if you wish to sync employee details to Xero. First name and Last name Email address Gender Address Postcode City Date of birth Country The employee data that will be synced is gathered from the fields above. ‚ö†Ô∏è  After the initial sync of your employees , r emember to always create and update employees in Planday, as this is a one-way sync. Some of my employees are not syncing to Xero If you are unable to sync Planday users to your Xero organisation, please check the following: Set up Banking - via Xero Organisation > Accounting > Bank Accounts > Add Bank Account The organisation‚Äôs region is supported by Planday. Currently, Planday only works with Xero organisations in the UK and Australia. The connected organization should be UK-based. Please note that special characters and numbers in the name such as  √¶, √∏, √•, √º  are not currently accepted by Xero. So if you have these special characters as part of your name or address fields, they would need to be changed to their equivalent standard alphabets. Also, ensure that there are no trailing spaces in the synced field values. You might encounter sync errors if any of the following information in employee data is missing: First and Last name Email address Gender Address Postcode City Date of birth Country ‚ö†Ô∏è  Make sure you don't archive any of the fields above for employee sync to work. You can update the missing employee information by navigating to  People > Employees >  Select the  employee  to edit  >  Click on  Edit > Personal details >  Update information . After you have added any missing information, return to the Integrations page and synchronise again. If you do not wish to sync an employee, you can ignore the warnings and continue. What if my employees belong to different Employee groups and have different wages? In this case, Xero will hold the earning rate. Planday will not be sending wage-related payroll data over to Xero.  This means that you'll have to have multiple earning rates set up within Xero, corresponding to each employee group, for each wage variation. You need to do the following:  Create multiple earning rates in Xero for each of your Employee group in Planday Assign a  salary code to each of your Employee group  in Planday Map these salary codes to the earning rates  you created in Xero from the Integrations settings in Planday. I have done the initial sync and have some leavers/deactivated employees still showing up. How can I prevent them from syncing? The first time you sync your employees, you will see deactivated users.  If you do not wish to sync the deactivated users, untick the checkbox next to their name and they won't be synced. What happens with my leavers/deactivated employees? The timesheets hours in that date range will still be sent to Xero. However, you will need to mark the employee as a leaver in Xero and process the last pay run there. Xero will also hold all of the information in regards to paying out or recovering any holiday.   Leave management How will holidays be managed with Planday and Xero UK? üí° Please, note that leave type synchronisation is only currently available for the Australian Xero integration. You need to set up a shift type for Leave and apply a  salary code  to it so that you can map it with the equivalent Xero Leave pay item. You can visit  Setup an employee‚Äôs leave entitlements  on  Xero Central  for information on Leave management in Xero. While you can record your holiday in Planday, we will not be sending leave related payroll data over to Xero. Planday will only send the date range of leave taken to Xero, therefore any payments, balances and accrual will be managed within Xero.  The holiday can be recorded by using shift types in Planday. You can  set up a shift type  in your portal and call it  Holiday - Xero  or use an existing shift type. In Planday you will be using  Fixed Vacation Accounts   or  Accrued Accounts .  Planday will handle the request and schedule of holidays whereas Xero will handle the  payment  and balance of holidays.  For any questions on how to add absence in Xero please contact the Xero support team or your account manager at Xero.   Time & Pay run syncing Are all the hours synced with Xero (including sickness)? In Planday, you‚Äôre only syncing the hours as long as you‚Äôve marked them with a salary code and you‚Äôve matched this salary code with the equivalent Xero pay item in your Xero integration. To sync the normal hours, you can assign a salary code to the shifts if you navigate to  Settings > Payroll > General,  scroll down to  Salary Codes  and enter the code for hourly workers in the  Hours worked (as per shifts)  field. If you‚Äôd like to sync the hours marked by a Shift type and that are related to sickness or overtime for example, you would need to apply a salary code to the shift type and map this salary code with the equivalent pay item in Xero. But if you want to exclude some hours, for example, if you‚Äôre using a shift type for sickness and you don‚Äôt want these hours to be synced to Xero, you can leave the salary code in the shift type blank. Some of my employees are not showing in the payroll preview If you are in  Xero Payroll  in Planday and some of your employees are not showing when you click on  Preview report , it can be because of the following reason: Your employees are assigned  personal Salary codes  which are not mapped with any of your pay items in Xero. To fix this issue, you would need to do the following: either map the personal salary codes with the Xero pay items in the Integration setting in Planday (link to Sync payroll data in Step 2 Final setup) or delete the personal salary codes and map the salary code of the employee group your employees are part of in Planday with the equivalent pay item in Xero. üí°  Please be aware of the following hierarchy when you assign salary codes in Planday: Are the pay rate and bank details updated in Xero? The pay rate and bank details of an employee will need to be maintained in both Planday and Xero. At the moment we are only sending over address and date of birth details to Xero. Why is the minutes count different in Xero from the Planday payroll preview? Time can be expressed either as fractions, decimals or as minutes and hours. To calculate payroll, time needs to be in decimal form so that it can be multiplied by an employee‚Äôs pay rate. Xero is an accounting software and will therefore report in decimal minutes. I can‚Äôt seem to see the correct date range in the Planday pay run You need to ensure that you have created a  draft pay run  setup in Xero before you can see the information in the Planday dropdown. Create a draft pay run by going to  Xero  >  Payroll  >  Pay employees.  Click  Add Pay Run  >   Select a pay period > press  Next.  Read   more  about this at Xero Central . I got an error code stating my employees need calendar IDs setup This means you have no employment record in the Xero setup. This could potentially be a new starter or someone who needs to be added to Xero. Follow the instructions from Xero Central on  Employee is missing from a pay run .   It can also be because some employees are assigned to a different calendar than what the selected pay runs belongs to. Can I redo the hours exported to Xero for some employees? For example, you moved some employees to another employee group, that would thus affect the pay. Say you‚Äôve already transferred the hours attached to the old employee group to Xero and you need to send these hours again. You would need to do the following in Xero: Revert the pay run to draft Remove any existing timesheets in the draft pay run for the specified employees by going to  Payroll  >  Timesheets  >  Select employee  >  Edit  >  Delete Timesheets . Then you can export the hours from Planday to Xero again under  Payroll  >  Xero payroll .   Supported functionalities & limitations Does the integration support tips or service charges? Service charges and tips are usually handled outside of Planday and directly through Xero. However, if you wish to manually enter tips into Planday you can do so by using a manual payroll supplement. You will then need to match the Xero earning rate to the salary code of the payroll supplement in Planday.   In some cases, this can be time-consuming and it may be quicker to manage supplements directly into Xero. Does the integration support my salaried staff? At the moment, the integration supports hourly workers only. Salaried staff in Xero will be paid out the same each pay period so there is no need to send the hours over to Xero. We will still keep the historical shift data on salaried employees in Planday. üí°  This data should not be pushed to Xero, as this will cause the salary to change based on the hours sent over to Xero. Do we support Xero in other countries? At the moment Xero integration with Planday is only supported in the UK and  Australia . What are the supported earning categories and rate types? Xero only allows the following earnings categories and rates for timesheets to be imported through the integration: Earning Categories Regular Earnings Overtime Earnings Rate types Rate per unit (Unit must be set to hours) Rate per hour   Need more help?

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For Planday admins using Xero in the UK. See  Xero Setup instructions here .   Integration setup My organisation is not connected successfully If you have the following message: ‚ÄúYou do not have sufficient payroll permissions‚Äù, it can be caused by two things: You need to ensure that the user who connected the organisation has payroll permissions in Xero and has not been deactivated. It can also be because the Payroll module of your organisation is not set up yet. To fix this, open  Xero.com , navigate to your Xero organisation and click  Payroll > Overview . Visiting this page will initialise the Payroll module and the next time you open the Xero integration in Planday, the status should be updated.   Employee syncing What information is required to add an employee in Planday and Xero? Ensure that the fields listed below are filled in the employee profile in Planday if you wish to sync employee details to Xero. First name and Last name Email address Gender Address Postcode City Date of birth Country The employee data that will be synced is gathered from the fields above. ‚ö†Ô∏è  After the initial sync of your employees , r emember to always create and update employees in Planday, as this is a one-way sync. Some of my employees are not syncing to Xero If you are unable to sync Planday users to your Xero organisation, please check the following: Set up Banking - via Xero Organisation > Accounting > Bank Accounts > Add Bank Account The organisation‚Äôs region is supported by Planday. Currently, Planday only works with Xero organisations in the UK and Australia. The connected organization should be UK-based. Please note that special characters and numbers in the name such as  √¶, √∏, √•, √º  are not currently accepted by Xero. So if you have these special characters as part of your name or address fields, they would need to be changed to their equivalent standard alphabets. Also, ensure that there are no trailing spaces in the synced field values. You might encounter sync errors if any of the following information in employee data is missing: First and Last name Email address Gender Address Postcode City Date of birth Country ‚ö†Ô∏è  Make sure you don't archive any of the fields above for employee sync to work. You can update the missing employee information by navigating to  People > Employees >  Select the  employee  to edit  >  Click on  Edit > Personal details >  Update information . After you have added any missing information, return to the Integrations page and synchronise again. If you do not wish to sync an employee, you can ignore the warnings and continue. What if my employees belong to different Employee groups and have different wages? In this case, Xero will hold the earning rate. Planday will not be sending wage-related payroll data over to Xero.  This means that you'll have to have multiple earning rates set up within Xero, corresponding to each employee group, for each wage variation. You need to do the following:  Create multiple earning rates in Xero for each of your Employee group in Planday Assign a  salary code to each of your Employee group  in Planday Map these salary codes to the earning rates  you created in Xero from the Integrations settings in Planday. I have done the initial sync and have some leavers/deactivated employees still showing up. How can I prevent them from syncing? The first time you sync your employees, you will see deactivated users.  If you do not wish to sync the deactivated users, untick the checkbox next to their name and they won't be synced. What happens with my leavers/deactivated employees? The timesheets hours in that date range will still be sent to Xero. However, you will need to mark the employee as a leaver in Xero and process the last pay run there. Xero will also hold all of the information in regards to paying out or recovering any holiday.   Leave management How will holidays be managed with Planday and Xero UK? üí° Please, note that leave type synchronisation is only currently available for the Australian Xero integration. You need to set up a shift type for Leave and apply a  salary code  to it so that you can map it with the equivalent Xero Leave pay item. You can visit  Setup an employee‚Äôs leave entitlements  on  Xero Central  for information on Leave management in Xero. While you can record your holiday in Planday, we will not be sending leave related payroll data over to Xero. Planday will only send the date range of leave taken to Xero, therefore any payments, balances and accrual will be managed within Xero.  The holiday can be recorded by using shift types in Planday. You can  set up a shift type  in your portal and call it  Holiday - Xero  or use an existing shift type. In Planday you will be using  Fixed Vacation Accounts   or  Accrued Accounts .  Planday will handle the request and schedule of holidays whereas Xero will handle the  payment  and balance of holidays.  For any questions on how to add absence in Xero please contact the Xero support team or your account manager at Xero.   Time & Pay run syncing Are all the hours synced with Xero (including sickness)? In Planday, you‚Äôre only syncing the hours as long as you‚Äôve marked them with a salary code and you‚Äôve matched this salary code with the equivalent Xero pay item in your Xero integration. To sync the normal hours, you can assign a salary code to the shifts if you navigate to  Settings > Payroll > General,  scroll down to  Salary Codes  and enter the code for hourly workers in the  Hours worked (as per shifts)  field. If you‚Äôd like to sync the hours marked by a Shift type and that are related to sickness or overtime for example, you would need to apply a salary code to the shift type and map this salary code with the equivalent pay item in Xero. But if you want to exclude some hours, for example, if you‚Äôre using a shift type for sickness and you don‚Äôt want these hours to be synced to Xero, you can leave the salary code in the shift type blank. Some of my employees are not showing in the payroll preview If you are in  Xero Payroll  in Planday and some of your employees are not showing when you click on  Preview report , it can be because of the following reason: Your employees are assigned  personal Salary codes  which are not mapped with any of your pay items in Xero. To fix this issue, you would need to do the following: either map the personal salary codes with the Xero pay items in the Integration setting in Planday (link to Sync payroll data in Step 2 Final setup) or delete the personal salary codes and map the salary code of the employee group your employees are part of in Planday with the equivalent pay item in Xero. üí°  Please be aware of the following hierarchy when you assign salary codes in Planday: Are the pay rate and bank details updated in Xero? The pay rate and bank details of an employee will need to be maintained in both Planday and Xero. At the moment we are only sending over address and date of birth details to Xero. Why is the minutes count different in Xero from the Planday payroll preview? Time can be expressed either as fractions, decimals or as minutes and hours. To calculate payroll, time needs to be in decimal form so that it can be multiplied by an employee‚Äôs pay rate. Xero is an accounting software and will therefore report in decimal minutes. I can‚Äôt seem to see the correct date range in the Planday pay run You need to ensure that you have created a  draft pay run  setup in Xero before you can see the information in the Planday dropdown. Create a draft pay run by going to  Xero  >  Payroll  >  Pay employees.  Click  Add Pay Run  >   Select a pay period > press  Next.  Read   more  about this at Xero Central . I got an error code stating my employees need calendar IDs setup This means you have no employment record in the Xero setup. This could potentially be a new starter or someone who needs to be added to Xero. Follow the instructions from Xero Central on  Employee is missing from a pay run .   It can also be because some employees are assigned to a different calendar than what the selected pay runs belongs to. Can I redo the hours exported to Xero for some employees? For example, you moved some employees to another employee group, that would thus affect the pay. Say you‚Äôve already transferred the hours attached to the old employee group to Xero and you need to send these hours again. You would need to do the following in Xero: Revert the pay run to draft Remove any existing timesheets in the draft pay run for the specified employees by going to  Payroll  >  Timesheets  >  Select employee  >  Edit  >  Delete Timesheets . Then you can export the hours from Planday to Xero again under  Payroll  >  Xero payroll .   Supported functionalities & limitations Does the integration support tips or service charges? Service charges and tips are usually handled outside of Planday and directly through Xero. However, if you wish to manually enter tips into Planday you can do so by using a manual payroll supplement. You will then need to match the Xero earning rate to the salary code of the payroll supplement in Planday.   In some cases, this can be time-consuming and it may be quicker to manage supplements directly into Xero. Does the integration support my salaried staff? At the moment, the integration supports hourly workers only. Salaried staff in Xero will be paid out the same each pay period so there is no need to send the hours over to Xero. We will still keep the historical shift data on salaried employees in Planday. üí°  This data should not be pushed to Xero, as this will cause the salary to change based on the hours sent over to Xero. Do we support Xero in other countries? At the moment Xero integration with Planday is only supported in the UK and  Australia . What are the supported earning categories and rate types? Xero only allows the following earnings categories and rates for timesheets to be imported through the integration: Earning Categories Regular Earnings Overtime Earnings Rate types Rate per unit (Unit must be set to hours) Rate per hour   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate Fortnox with Planday. Looking for the Fortnox setup guide? See  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 1 . FAQs What data will be synced during payroll sync? Hours, supplements, meal deductions, and meal contributions with supported cause codes and salary codes will be transferred to Fortnox only for the employees included in the mapping between Planday & Fortnox.    Pay rates or monthly salaries will not be synced to Fortnox, but depending on your integration settings, Planday can fetch pay rates and salaries of mapped employees from Fortnox to Planday daily at 03:00 am. üí°Please keep in mind that there might be differences between pay rates in Planday Preview and the rates in Fortnox. Can the old file export still be used? The file export can still be used for other Swedish payroll systems, but we recommend using the dedicated  integration for Fortnox  sync since it supports the functionality of the file export and much more. Does the payroll sync include the worked hours of salaried employees? Yes, but this needs to be set up per employee in Planday. Read more in the  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 2  article. What kind of allocation method is used when monthly salaries are synced from Fortnox? Scheduled hours. Will newly created employees in Fortnox automatically be added to Planday? No, employee accounts will not be automatically created in Planday. If you wish to push Fortnox employee data to Planday, you can navigate to the Fortnox integration and choose which employees you'd like to import from Fortnox. Read more in the  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 1  article. Will newly created employees in Planday automatically be added to Fortnox? This is not done automatically, but when creating new employees in Planday, admins can select  Create new user in Fortnox  to send the newly created employee over. How can I add new employees to an existing employee data mapping? When Fortnox is active and running, you can add the employee directly to Fortnox and save them to the existing mapping while creating their account. For your new hires, you'd go to  People  >  Employees  >  Create employee  and fill in their details as you normally would. You will also find a Fortnox section where you can press  Add  to add the employee mapping. Here, you can choose whether to add them to an existing employee entry from the  Fortnox user  dropdown or decide to create a new employee automatically, which also means that you will  not  need to add them in Fortnox manually. üí° If you have more than one  Fortnox account  connected, you can choose which account the new employee should be added to. Please keep in mind that if you choose to  Create a new user in Fortnox , you will need to make sure that none of the required fields in Fortnox is left empty, in addition to any required fields you might have set in Planday.   At this step, the required information for the employee entry in Fortnox will also be required in Planday, and if anything is missing, it will be highlighted as required when you try to Save.   Once everything is in place, you'll see a confirmation message when you save your employee's data.   To verify, if you click on quick-edit for the newly created employee entry, you will see a confirmation that the employee data is being successfully synced to Fortnox.   However, if the sync fails, a red error message will be shown, explaining what went wrong or how to fix it. How can I verify whether an employee's data is mapped? To check that an existing employee in Planday is mapped in Fortnox, go to  People  >  Employees , find the employee and open the  quick edit view  (‚úèÔ∏è icon).   The employee profile will have a  Fortnox  section, where you can see a label showing the name of the connected Fortnox account. If the data is mapped and synced correctly, a confirmation message will be shown in green.   How can I remove an employee from an existing employee data mapping? Navigate to  People  >  Employees  > select the employee you need to remove and click on the quick edit icon ( ‚úèÔ∏è ). In the  Fortnox  section, click the X icon next to the Fortnox account label to remove the mapping and click  Save  to confirm. Can I include Cost centres (Resultatenheter/Kostnadsst√§llen)? Yes, you can sync data with Cost centre allocation by enabling that functionality in the integration editor and adding your Fortnox Cost centre codes into Department numbers in Planday. Are vacation days/hours from the Absence accounts in Planday supported? No, please use  Shift types  with the Cause code / Salary code ‚Äú SEM ‚Äù instead. Can I export overtime or flex, or vacation account balances? No. Are manual, weekly, personal or seniority supplements supported? No. What happens if my organisation uses different employee salary identifiers in different departments? The integration recognises only the main ‚ÄúSalary identifier‚Äù field, but it is still possible to use the integration. If salary identifiers do not appear to be correct on your employee mapping, you might need to make edits in the Employee form and payroll preview. Does the integration respect the payroll setting: ‚Äúexclude zero-hours from export‚Äù and ‚Äúexclude salary codes‚Äù? Yes. What happens if I have clicked Sync several times for the same pay run period? All the previous data for the same employees for the same salary codes/cause codes and date ranges will be cleared in Fortnox, before new data will be transferred. Which fields are required when I want my Planday employee to be created in Fortnox automatically? Personal Identity Number (PD SSN/Tax ID) Employee Id (PD salary identifier) First name Last name Address1 Post Code City Which fields are required when I want my Fortnox employee entry to automatically be created as a new user in Planday? In Planday, the following fields are always required to create an employee. First Name Last Name Email (used as username in Planday)  In addition, there may be customised settings for your organisation that you may want to keep in sync. You can see or update your  Employee form  settings by visiting  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup. ‚ö†Ô∏è  We recommend not to rename system fields in the form to avoid confusion. If you wish to import employees from Fortnox, you must not mark any additional fields as required, as the integration cannot populate custom fields, and the import will fail. What are Cause codes? Cause codes are the equivalent of a Swedish term,  Registreringskoder,  which defines groupings of salary codes that can be found in Fortnox. These Cause codes determine whether the shift/hours represent working time, different types of absence, or supplements.    The data synchronised is grouped by Employee and per Cause code for all pay types, except meal contributions and meal deductions which use  Salary codes  instead.   Using Cause codes can save you a lot of time and tedious work. For example, you do not have to record personal leave and sickness as two different Shift types (with different Salary codes), but instead with one Shift type with one Cause code. Based on the Cause code, Fortnox will use its built-in logic to determine which Salary codes to assign to different hours for sick pay or vacation pay based on the employees‚Äô settings in Fortnox and their current balances. What is a Salary code? Salary codes  in Planday are similar to what Cause codes are in Fortnox. Essentially Salary codes in Planday are used to identify specific types of shifts to match with their corresponding Cause code values in Fortnox. The rate per hour on the monthly salary of an employee shows up as ‚Äúinfinity‚Äù. Why? This means that the employee data has no value for ‚ÄúContracted hours‚Äù in Planday, prior to the first monthly salary being added by the integration. In these cases, the  Contracted hours  field is empty, and the system cannot calculate the correct hourly rate. You can fix this by editing the monthly salary and entering a number into the ‚ÄúContracted hours‚Äù field. I encounter errors when I try to Sync my payroll data to Fortnox. What can I do? The  Sync status  will show how many employees could not have the payroll data successfully exported. It will also list any employees whose payroll data could not be synced. (as shown in the screenshot below). By clicking on each employee‚Äôs name or the row, you'll see more details about the specific pay items that failed to sync, including: the  date  for the pay item the  type :  Worked hours (regular hours and supplements) Absence (hours from shift types that are categorised as absence) Meal contribution or meal deduction The type can indicate which Shift caused the error. If the error is not immediately apparent, review the checklist described in this  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 2  article or contact our support team for assistance.   I get a *Salary code not matching the Cost code error* when I try to sync my payroll data to Fortnox. What can I do? This could be because one of the cost code values is not in use or misspelt. Please ensure you use the correct cost codes when entering them in the salary code fields in Planday. See the supported Cost codes values here. What Cause codes are supported? When editing Shift types or supplements in Planday, you can use the corresponding supported Cause codes to identify them in Fortnox. Code Description Common Planday usage Type ARB Timl√∂n / Hourly pay Shift data (Shift type: normal) for hourly-paid employees Worked Hours TID Arbetstid / Worked hours Shift data (Shift type: normal) of monthly paid employees Most customers use the setting to exclude this from export.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate Fortnox with Planday. Looking for the Fortnox setup guide? See  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 1 . FAQs What data will be synced during payroll sync? Hours, supplements, meal deductions, and meal contributions with supported cause codes and salary codes will be transferred to Fortnox only for the employees included in the mapping between Planday & Fortnox.    Pay rates or monthly salaries will not be synced to Fortnox, but depending on your integration settings, Planday can fetch pay rates and salaries of mapped employees from Fortnox to Planday daily at 03:00 am. üí°Please keep in mind that there might be differences between pay rates in Planday Preview and the rates in Fortnox. Can the old file export still be used? The file export can still be used for other Swedish payroll systems, but we recommend using the dedicated  integration for Fortnox  sync since it supports the functionality of the file export and much more. Does the payroll sync include the worked hours of salaried employees? Yes, but this needs to be set up per employee in Planday. Read more in the  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 2  article. What kind of allocation method is used when monthly salaries are synced from Fortnox? Scheduled hours. Will newly created employees in Fortnox automatically be added to Planday? No, employee accounts will not be automatically created in Planday. If you wish to push Fortnox employee data to Planday, you can navigate to the Fortnox integration and choose which employees you'd like to import from Fortnox. Read more in the  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 1  article. Will newly created employees in Planday automatically be added to Fortnox? This is not done automatically, but when creating new employees in Planday, admins can select  Create new user in Fortnox  to send the newly created employee over. How can I add new employees to an existing employee data mapping? When Fortnox is active and running, you can add the employee directly to Fortnox and save them to the existing mapping while creating their account. For your new hires, you'd go to  People  >  Employees  >  Create employee  and fill in their details as you normally would. You will also find a Fortnox section where you can press  Add  to add the employee mapping. Here, you can choose whether to add them to an existing employee entry from the  Fortnox user  dropdown or decide to create a new employee automatically, which also means that you will  not  need to add them in Fortnox manually. üí° If you have more than one  Fortnox account  connected, you can choose which account the new employee should be added to. Please keep in mind that if you choose to  Create a new user in Fortnox , you will need to make sure that none of the required fields in Fortnox is left empty, in addition to any required fields you might have set in Planday.   At this step, the required information for the employee entry in Fortnox will also be required in Planday, and if anything is missing, it will be highlighted as required when you try to Save.   Once everything is in place, you'll see a confirmation message when you save your employee's data.   To verify, if you click on quick-edit for the newly created employee entry, you will see a confirmation that the employee data is being successfully synced to Fortnox.   However, if the sync fails, a red error message will be shown, explaining what went wrong or how to fix it. How can I verify whether an employee's data is mapped? To check that an existing employee in Planday is mapped in Fortnox, go to  People  >  Employees , find the employee and open the  quick edit view  (‚úèÔ∏è icon).   The employee profile will have a  Fortnox  section, where you can see a label showing the name of the connected Fortnox account. If the data is mapped and synced correctly, a confirmation message will be shown in green.   How can I remove an employee from an existing employee data mapping? Navigate to  People  >  Employees  > select the employee you need to remove and click on the quick edit icon ( ‚úèÔ∏è ). In the  Fortnox  section, click the X icon next to the Fortnox account label to remove the mapping and click  Save  to confirm. Can I include Cost centres (Resultatenheter/Kostnadsst√§llen)? Yes, you can sync data with Cost centre allocation by enabling that functionality in the integration editor and adding your Fortnox Cost centre codes into Department numbers in Planday. Are vacation days/hours from the Absence accounts in Planday supported? No, please use  Shift types  with the Cause code / Salary code ‚Äú SEM ‚Äù instead. Can I export overtime or flex, or vacation account balances? No. Are manual, weekly, personal or seniority supplements supported? No. What happens if my organisation uses different employee salary identifiers in different departments? The integration recognises only the main ‚ÄúSalary identifier‚Äù field, but it is still possible to use the integration. If salary identifiers do not appear to be correct on your employee mapping, you might need to make edits in the Employee form and payroll preview. Does the integration respect the payroll setting: ‚Äúexclude zero-hours from export‚Äù and ‚Äúexclude salary codes‚Äù? Yes. What happens if I have clicked Sync several times for the same pay run period? All the previous data for the same employees for the same salary codes/cause codes and date ranges will be cleared in Fortnox, before new data will be transferred. Which fields are required when I want my Planday employee to be created in Fortnox automatically? Personal Identity Number (PD SSN/Tax ID) Employee Id (PD salary identifier) First name Last name Address1 Post Code City Which fields are required when I want my Fortnox employee entry to automatically be created as a new user in Planday? In Planday, the following fields are always required to create an employee. First Name Last Name Email (used as username in Planday)  In addition, there may be customised settings for your organisation that you may want to keep in sync. You can see or update your  Employee form  settings by visiting  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup. ‚ö†Ô∏è  We recommend not to rename system fields in the form to avoid confusion. If you wish to import employees from Fortnox, you must not mark any additional fields as required, as the integration cannot populate custom fields, and the import will fail. What are Cause codes? Cause codes are the equivalent of a Swedish term,  Registreringskoder,  which defines groupings of salary codes that can be found in Fortnox. These Cause codes determine whether the shift/hours represent working time, different types of absence, or supplements.    The data synchronised is grouped by Employee and per Cause code for all pay types, except meal contributions and meal deductions which use  Salary codes  instead.   Using Cause codes can save you a lot of time and tedious work. For example, you do not have to record personal leave and sickness as two different Shift types (with different Salary codes), but instead with one Shift type with one Cause code. Based on the Cause code, Fortnox will use its built-in logic to determine which Salary codes to assign to different hours for sick pay or vacation pay based on the employees‚Äô settings in Fortnox and their current balances. What is a Salary code? Salary codes  in Planday are similar to what Cause codes are in Fortnox. Essentially Salary codes in Planday are used to identify specific types of shifts to match with their corresponding Cause code values in Fortnox. The rate per hour on the monthly salary of an employee shows up as ‚Äúinfinity‚Äù. Why? This means that the employee data has no value for ‚ÄúContracted hours‚Äù in Planday, prior to the first monthly salary being added by the integration. In these cases, the  Contracted hours  field is empty, and the system cannot calculate the correct hourly rate. You can fix this by editing the monthly salary and entering a number into the ‚ÄúContracted hours‚Äù field. I encounter errors when I try to Sync my payroll data to Fortnox. What can I do? The  Sync status  will show how many employees could not have the payroll data successfully exported. It will also list any employees whose payroll data could not be synced. (as shown in the screenshot below). By clicking on each employee‚Äôs name or the row, you'll see more details about the specific pay items that failed to sync, including: the  date  for the pay item the  type :  Worked hours (regular hours and supplements) Absence (hours from shift types that are categorised as absence) Meal contribution or meal deduction The type can indicate which Shift caused the error. If the error is not immediately apparent, review the checklist described in this  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 2  article or contact our support team for assistance.   I get a *Salary code not matching the Cost code error* when I try to sync my payroll data to Fortnox. What can I do? This could be because one of the cost code values is not in use or misspelt. Please ensure you use the correct cost codes when entering them in the salary code fields in Planday. See the supported Cost codes values here. What Cause codes are supported? When editing Shift types or supplements in Planday, you can use the corresponding supported Cause codes to identify them in Fortnox. Code Description Common Planday usage Type ARB Timl√∂n / Hourly pay Shift data (Shift type: normal) for hourly-paid employees Worked Hours TID Arbetstid / Worked hours Shift data (Shift type: normal) of monthly paid employees Most customers use the setting to exclude this from export.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate Fortnox with Planday. Are you looking for the Fortnox FAQ? See  Fortnox integration - FAQ and troubleshooting . Connect Planday with Fortnox to keep your information up to date in both systems and make managing data more manageable and time-efficient. You can manage and sync data with just a few clicks when the integration runs.   This guide will walk you through the steps needed to configure the connection between Planday and Fortnox, including connecting to a Fortnox account and mapping employee data across the systems. Connect your Fortnox account This will open a new view where you need to configure the integration. Activate the integration by pressing the toggle. In the Accounts section, press  Add , which will redirect you to Fortnox's login page, where you need to log in to your Fortnox account.   After logging in, you can review the requested permissions and authorise the connection to Planday. üí° You must have  sysadmin  rights in Fortnox to authorise the application. If you do not already have one, you must obtain a Fortnox integration license. (More information on the Fortnox pricing  page ). When the authorisation is successful, you'll be redirected back to Planday on the integration settings page. Open the Fortnox integration again by pressing  Manage . You should now see the account name you just connected listed in the  Accounts  section. With at least one Fortnox account connected, you can go on to match the employee data between Planday and Fortnox.   Create an employee data mapping For the integration to work as intended, you need to set up an employee mapping to ensure that the employee information in Planday matches their corresponding employee data entries in Fortnox. This is required to enable integration and guarantee that the data will be synced correctly between the two systems.   From the Fortnox integration settings page, in the  Employee data  section, press  Create mapping .   Next, select one of your connected  Fortnox accounts . If you have any employee records in Fortnox that do not yet exist in Planday, those can be created automatically. That is why the next step is to select a Department in Planday for the new employee data.  üí°  You can change an Employee's department later by going to  People  >  Employees  and clicking their name to edit their information. Verify employee data mapping Once the data is loaded, it will be displayed for you to verify and confirm or fix any inconsistencies before the mapping is created.   This list should contain the employee entries from Planday (with their salary identifier), their counterpart entry from Fortnox (with their employee ID), and the sync status between the two systems.   Matching existing employees Suggested matches: The automatically matched suggestions are marked by a blue link icon. Based on the employee's username (email address) in Planday and their email address in Fortnox. It can also be based on their ID when the Planday salary identifier matches their employee ID in Fortnox. Manual matches: Also marked by a blue link icon. For employees with data in both systems but for which the email or the salary identifier does not match, you can create a link from the  Add employees  button. Once added to the mapping their profiles match accordingly in the list, the blue link icon should show, confirming their status.  After you click  Add employees , you can switch between two lists of employee data entries, from Planday and Fortnox.  After selecting which employees to add to the mapping from the lists, click  Save . If no employees on the list need to be added or you don't have changes to make, click  Cancel  to return to the previous view. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è A red warning icon next to an employee entry means that information is missing from some fields. Please keep in mind to check that the Planday required fields for employee data are not empty when creating a mapping between Fortnox and Planday. You can check and configure the required property for the data field in  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup .   Importing employees Marked by a  green  icon.  If data for an employee only exists only in Planday or only in Fortnox, you'll also need to add them manually. Click the  + Add employees  button, select the employees available from either list and then press  Save . This will create a new employee entry in Planday or Fortnox.  Please note that different data fields may be required in each system, and those cannot be empty. If a required field is empty, a red warning icon will appear next to that employee‚Äôs name. This means that you will not only be able to create a new employee entry before all the required fields have relevant data. However, you would be able to map that employee to an already existing entry. You can read more about it in the  Fortnox FAQ article . üí° At any point during the process, you can check out the  Summary  box on the right-hand side. This shows the number of employees grouped by status and reflects what will happen when the integration is saved. If you hover over the info icon in the Summary box, you'll get a list of what information with be synced from Planday to Fortnox when updated in Planday. Once you match employee records from the two systems, you're ready to add the mapping to your integration. Press  Add to integration  button in the top right corner.   Editing or deleting employee mappings You can always change the mapping you created between the two systems by going to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview ,   finding the Fortnox Integration, and then clicking  Manage.   Under  Employee data , you'll find the existing mappings. Click anywhere on the row or hover over the row and select the  Edit  ( ‚úèÔ∏è ) icon.   Here, you can select a new default Department (within Planday) or continue to edit the existing mapping by clicking  Sync .  Similar to creating an employee mapping, you can fine-tune the individual employee mappings. You might notice a grey icon in the Status column when editing an employee data mapping. This indicates that the mapping for that employee has already been created. Additionally, some employees may have a  yellow  icon as their Status, representing that their profile has been deactivated in Planday. If you want to exclude employees from your existing mapping, you can remove them one by one from the  X  icon on their row. Once you're done with the necessary changes, click  Save .   If you want to  delete an employee mapping entirely  (or remove the mapping for all the mapped employees at once), click the Delete ( üóë ) icon by hovering over the name of the mapping.   Additional Employee data settings You'll notice two options turned on by default in the  Employee data  section. Here is what they do: Keep Fortnox up to date with employee data from Planday -  Synchronise the changes to employee data fields from Planday to Fortnox. (Changes are synced instantly to Fortnox.) Keep Planday up to date with the latest pay rates and monthly salaries from Fortnox -  Synchronize the hourly rates and fixed monthly salary rates from Fortnox to Planday  (daily sync at 03:00 am). Here, you can also see a quick overview of your existing mapping. This includes the Planday Department where the newly added employees will be created (if any) and a reference for how many employees have their data included in the mapping. When you've mapped employees and adjusted sync settings, you can move to the next step and set up payroll.   Next: Manage and sync payroll data to Fortnox   Need more help?

If your Personio API credentials have changed, update them in the Integration overview >  Personio  >  Manage company  >  Change credentials .   Employee import Why can‚Äôt all my Departments be imported? Depending on your Planday plan, there may be a maximum number of Departments you can set up. On the Starter plan, you are limited to having 1 Department, while the Plus and Pro plans allow up to 5 or more Departments. Imports will possibly be incomplete, if this number is exceeded.  Read here, how to handle the Departments limit . Why can‚Äôt my employees be imported? If you have an error message saying that your employees couldn‚Äôt be imported from Personio into Planday, it could be because of the following reason: You have some required fields for employee creation in the employee form setup in Planday. If the required fields that are set in Planday are missing in Personio for the employees you‚Äôre trying to import, then the import won‚Äôt happen To fix this, you can either: In Personio: fill out the required fields in the employees‚Äô profiles Or in Planday: go to  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup  > find the required fields and edit them Under  Create employee , untick the box  Required field ‚¨áÔ∏è   Then in Planday, go back to Personio‚Äôs integrations settings and try and import your employees again. What happens if a mapped employee is deleted in Personio? If the option  Import all current and future employees  is enabled in the integration setup, the employee will be deactivated in Planday during automatic sync at 11 PM of the following day. If there are future shifts, they are changed into Open shifts starting deactivation date. Future absences created by the integration will be removed. If the option is not selected, no changes will be made automatically. What happens, when I delete the Employee group ‚ÄúPersonio‚Äú? It is not recommended to delete this Employee group. You can keep it, and additionally assign your employees to other Employee groups as well.  If you delete this Employee group, you risk losing information on hourly wages or salary.   If the option  Import all current and future employees  is enabled in the integration setup, the Employee group would be added again during the sync at night, and employees would be re-added to it. How do I see which employees are mapped between Personio and Planday? You can check this in Planday by going to the Employee group  Personio  under  People > Employee groups . This group is automatically assigned to all mapped employees. What happens if an employee already exists? If an employee profile with a matching e-mail address is detected during import, that account will be overwritten by the new employee data from Personio. Why can‚Äôt I select an employee for import? Employees can only be selected for import if their Personio profile contains a First name, Last name and email address. What happens when I update employee information in Planday? Personio to Planday is a one way synchronisation, which means that employee information is pulled from Personio at the time of sync and updated in Planday. If you use this integration, we recommend using Personio as the main source of employee information and update any changes there instead of in Planday.   Absence data import Can I add imported absence to the employees‚Äô Absence accounts? If the system you are using for absence management is Personio, the purpose of having that information in Planday is barely to keep an overview when you plan your schedule. Therefore, it is shown as shifts. As of now, no automated function connected to Planday Absence accounts is planned. üí°  The shift types assigned to absence shifts are named after the Persionio absence type name (full or half day), or called Personio (hourly) . What Personio absence types are imported? Approved  absences of the type daily, half-daily or hourly can be imported. What happens, if employees already have assigned shifts that the absence interferes with? If the absence is day based, the shift would be assigned the Shift type for the absence. If the absence is hourly, the import will create an additional shift (with the Shift type for absence) additionally to the one already existing. What happens if changes to already imported absence data is made in Personio? If the option  Import current and future absence data  is enabled in the integration setup, the shift in Planday that represents the absence will be updated or deleted during the automatic sync at 11 pm.

If you‚Äôre using Lohn AG to manage your company payroll, quickly export your payroll data from Planday into a payroll report based on the worktime import to Lohn AG. Follow the steps below to get the most out of using Lohn AG and Planday.   1. Activate payroll export for Lohn AG Log into Planday and go to the integration page in  Settings > Integrations > All . Find  Lohn AG,  click  Add,  and press  Activate.   2. Add salary identifiers & codes to Planday To ensure you have the correct payroll format to match your records in both systems, you need to add your salary identifiers and salary codes from Lohn AG to Planday.   Salary identifiers To update each employee in Planday with their unique salary identifier from your integration, go to  People > select and edit employee > Employee Details > Payroll > add Salary identifier.   Salary codes Update Planday with Salary codes from Lohn AG so it can identify if the data in the export file should be counted as normal hours, special hours or payroll supplements.    If you want to apply salary codes for Payroll supplements, you need to create the payroll supplements and then add the salary code according to the specifications from Lohn AG, which you can also see below. Create the payroll supplements in  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplements.   If you are using Planday to register e.g. sickness and it's created as a shift type, you can also apply salary codes to that specific  Shift types.  Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types  and  edit  the shift type you want to apply the salary code for.   Lohn AG is working with specific salary codes for the shift types, which you can see here:   Finally, if you want to separate the hours between different employee groups for the employees payroll, you can apply specific salary codes to different employee groups. Apply salary codes to employee groups in the top menu  People  >  Employee groups  > and edit the employee group to enter the salary code. The salary code for the employee group will then overwrite the salary code for normal worked hours. Learn more about  Preparing for payroll .   Before exporting the payroll export file, remember to check up on approved shifts.   3. Export Lohn AG payroll reports from Planday Go to  Payroll > Payroll export . Choose date interval. Choose between all employees or only specific employee groups or employees. In the File Format field choose  Lohn AG . Press  Prepare report. Save the file on your desktop.   4.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins. If you are currently using Planday‚Äôs old absence module (pre-November 2021) and you want to switch to using the new Accrued Absence accounts, you can follow the step-by-step guide for  Transitioning to the new accrued Absence accounts . Planday offers the possibility of keeping track of your employees' absences, allowing them to request time off for a specific day or period. As a manager, you can receive a notification about the request and can take action immediately.   An Accrued absence account (or Accrued leave if you have selected UK English as your Planday language) is a holiday allowance where the number of days or hours are earned over time. In some cases, there is a starting balance of days that can be used.    Most accrued Absence accounts build up holidays based on an earning rate that is regulated by the local government following labour laws. The account is reset after a period with options to carry over unused time.  üí°If you want to set up a Fixed absence account where employees have a set number of days or hours to request off, you can find an alternate setup guide for Fixed Absence accounts  here . Set up accrued Absence account template Before using the absence feature in Planday, you must create an account template to allocate holidays.   Go to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  (or  Absence, Overtime, Vacation ) >  Account templates  > press the  Create  button.   Choose the  Leave account  (or  Absence account )   Here you can set the details for your account template by following the three steps below.    Step 1 of 3 - Set name and period Name:  Set a name for your leave account such as Earned vacation, Holiday leave, or similar. We recommend setting names without years so they can be utilized again.   Description:  Optional field to add a description for the account.   Renew automatically : We recommend 'Yes'. If you leave this unchecked the account will not be renewed automatically and you will need to manually create new accounts every year, when the old ones are out of date.   Accruing period - Annual start date:  Accruing period is the duration in which the absence is accumulated. Set a date from which the account should start accumulating leave.   Accruing period - Duration:  Set how many months the accruing period should be typically 12 months.   Spending period - Annual start date:  The spending period is when the employee is eligible to spend their earned leave. This can be set as the same date the accruing period starts.   Spending period - Duration:  Set a deadline for upto many months the employees should be able to spend their vacation (1-52 months).   When you have filled your desired settings, press  Next .   Step 2 of 3 - Setup Accrual rate, Requirements for accrual and applicable Shift types Accruing in:  Choose if the accruing should be in Days or Hours. Start balance : you have the option to set a start balance for the account template. This value will be the start balance on all accounts both now and in the future.  The start balance can later be overwritten in your employee's individual accounts for each period. Accruing rate:  For  Days  choose between ‚ÄúPercentage‚Äù, ‚ÄúDays per month‚Äù or ‚ÄúDays per year‚Äù. For  Hours  choose between ‚ÄúPercentage‚Äù, ‚ÄúHours per day‚Äù or ‚ÄúHours per month‚Äù. For Days or Hours per day/month/year: enter the number that fits your country.  For Percentage, here are some commonly used rates: 12,07 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 28 days 12,55 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 29 days 13,04 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 30 days 13,54 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 31 days 14,04 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 32 days 14,54 %  rate calculated based on days off per year: 33 days Average working week (Calendar week method) : Read more  here . Use this handy tool from  Gov.UK  to calculate various holiday entitlements.  Max allowance / CAP:  Choose between ‚ÄúDays per Month‚Äù, ‚ÄúDays per Year‚Äù, ‚ÄúHours per Day‚Äù or ‚ÄúHours per month‚Äú and enter the maximum allowed earnings per the period you have chosen.  Leave blank for unlimited. Requirements for accrual: ( only available if the account has an accrual rate per day/month/year.)  Choose if the requirements for accrual should always accrue, or depend on approved shifts in the schedule. Shift types:  Select the applicable shift types that should count towards the accrual. These can be normal shifts, overtime and may exclude sick days or no-shows depending on your company‚Äôs policies.  Monetary payout:  Choose if the payout of vacation should be based on an average of 12, 13 or 52 weeks, or set a fixed rate. Select  Do not use  if this does not apply to your region. When you have filled in your desired settings, press  Next .   Step 3 of 3 - Customise leave account details Employee types, Departments, and Employee groups:  These options make it possible to limit which employees can use the specific vacation account you are creating. For example, if you only wish to use vacation in a specific department, you can limit access with this option. Apply Automatically:  If you select this option, the system will automatically apply this Account template for all new and existing employees who match the selected options. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Please be aware of the allocations you set up in this section. The accumulation rate, accumulation period and spending period would automatically apply to the matching employees. However, these can be edited manually per employee should you need to make changes in the future or delete the allocations. Negative balance : Select the checkbox if the employees should be able to request more days/hours than their existing balance. If you leave this  unchecked  the account will not allow a negative value. Ex. if one employee has a balance of five days and makes a request for absence for seven days, the employee cannot apply for time off in that period as the cost exceed the balance. Max consecutive leave days ( or  Max consecutive absence days):  Here you can set a restriction on the number of days off that can be taken in a row as leave. You can select "" unlimited "", which is the most common setting, or ""set fixed limit"". When selecting ""unlimited"", the administrator will still have to approve a holiday request and thus have the option to reject an extended holiday if necessary. Carry-over:  Allow you to carry over days to the next period if you want to transfer any unused holidays/hours to the next holiday year. In this case, the system itself will create a new holiday account called ""Carry over"" when the consumption period is over. When Carry over is selected, you must specify how many days/hours a maximum can be transferred and if these days must have a different/fixed holding period. If the latter is left blank, the validity of the transfer account will be 12 months. üí° This point is very closely related to the Spending period point (see  step 1 of 3 ). An example would be if your employees are allowed to carry over a maximum of 5 days into the new year and must also take them by 1 March, otherwise, they will expire. In this example, you should leave the Spending period at 12 months and select the *Carry over* function.   Please note that the carry-over account is only created at the end of your period of use (usually 1 January). This account would then be valid until 31 March with 5 days of carryover balance. Payroll:  Here you can set up a  Salary code  for this leave template. These salary codes will show on your payroll reports in Planday, for displaying detailed information on leave, and help your Payroll integration modules understand the type of leave being reported. Account priority:  If you have more than one leave account and you want your employees to use one account before they can use another, you can adjust it here. Bank holiday calendar : If your Planday has a  holiday calendar set up , it is possible to link the calendar to the vacation account. Once your bank holiday calendar is associated, it will affect the cost for created/requested vacation. For example, an employee has requested time off from Monday to Friday (5 days). If Tuesday is a bank holiday, the suggested cost will be 4 days instead of 5 days.   Default Shift type for overlapping shifts:  You can select a Shift type here as a preselected option, which will make sure that, when approving Absence requests, the right Shift type will be pre-filled as the default Shift type. Remember to press  Save  before exiting.   Visibility of approved absence requests in the schedule When an employee has requested time off and you have approved it, this will be marked in the schedule. Approved time off does not prevent you from scheduling an employee, but their name will be marked in red in the employee selector. If you assign a Shift to an employee during their time off, you will notice a red icon on that shift letting you know that you need to adjust the Schedule.

As a manager, you can receive a notification about the request and can take action immediately.    A fixed Absence account has a stipulated amount of days or hours per year from which the employee deducts holidays. A fixed account does not accrue or earn holidays on an ongoing basis and is reset every year with options to carry over unused time. Follow this step-by-step guide on setting up fixed account templates and then apply them to your employees or employee groups. üí° If you want to set up an Accrued account with the option to add an accruing rate per year, month, day, or in percentage, you can find an alternate setup guide for Accrued Absence accounts  here . Set up a fixed Absence account template Before you can start using the absence module, you need to create a leave account template to allocate holidays from.   Go to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  (or  Absence, Overtime, Vacation ) >  Account templates  > press the  Create  button.   Choose the  Leave account  (or  Absence account )   Here you can set the details for your account template by following 3 steps. Below we show an example of how to complete the 3 steps when creating an Account for a fixed holiday.   Step 1 of 3 - Set name and period Name : Set a name for your leave account such as Salaried vacation, Maternity leave, or similar. For example, you can set up a Fixed Absence account balance to indicate the maximum paid sick leave an employee is allowed to have and allocate days from it throughout the year. We recommend setting names without years so they can be utilized again. Description:  Here you can give your account a description if you want. (optional) Renew automatically : We recommend 'Yes'. If you leave this unchecked the account will not be renewed automatically and you will need to manually create new accounts every year, when the old ones are out of date. Accruing period:  As this is a fixed account, set the date from when your company's vacation year starts and the duration of your vacation period. Spending period - Annual start date:  The spending period is when the employee is eligible to spend their assigned leave. This can be set as the same date the leave period starts. Spending period:  Set a deadline for up to many months the employees should be able to spend their vacation (1-52 months). When you have filled your desired settings, press  Next .   Step 2 of 3 - Setup start balance  Accruing in:  Under the  Starting balance  field, enter the value of days or hours per year. You can change this value for the specific employee. The starting balance as stated here will be the balance that can be seen on each employee's absence account each time a new consumption period starts.   Accruing rate:  When creating a fixed holiday account, select "" Do not use "" under the Accruing rate.    Monetary payout:  Select Do not use.    Step 3 of 3 - Customise account details  Employee types, Departments, and Employee groups:  These options make it possible to limit which employees can use the specific vacation account you are creating. For example, if you only wish to use vacation in a specific department, you can limit access with this option.   Apply Automatically:  If you select this option, the system will automatically apply this Account template for all new and existing employees who match the selected options. üí°  Please be aware of the allocations you set up in this section. The number of fixed holidays, accumulation period and spending period would automatically apply to the matching employees. However, these can be edited manually per employee should you need to make changes in the future or delete the allocations. Negative balance : Select the checkbox if the employees should be able to request more days/hours than their existing balance. If you leave this  unchecked  the account will not allow a negative value. Ex. if one employee has a balance of 5 days and makes a request absence for 7 days, the employee cannot apply for time off in that period as the cost exceed the balance.   Max consecutive leave days ( or  Max consecutive absence days):  Here you can set a restriction on the number of days off that can be taken in a row as leave. You can select "" unlimited "", which is the most common setting, or ""set fixed limit"". When selecting ""unlimited"", the administrator will still have to approve a holiday request and thus have the option to reject an extended holiday if necessary.   Carry over:  Allow you to carry over days to the next period if you want to transfer any unused holidays/hours to the next holiday year. In this case, the system itself will create a new holiday account called ""Carry over"" when the consumption period is over. When Carry over is selected, you must specify how many days/hours a maximum can be transferred and if these days must have a different/fixed holding period. If the latter is left blank, the validity of the transfer account will be 12 months. üí° This point is very closely related to the Spending period point (see step 1 of 3). An example would be if your employees are allowed to carry over a maximum of 5 days into the new year and must also take them by 1 March, otherwise they will expire. In this example, you should leave the Spending period at 12 months and select the *Carry over* function. Please note that the carry over account is only created at the end of your period of use (usually 1 January). This account would then be valid until 31 March with 5 days of carryover balance. Payroll:  Here you can set up a  Salary code  for this leave template. These salary codes will be based on your payroll reports, for displaying detailed information on leaves, and help your Payroll integration modules understand the type of leave being reported. Account priority:  If you have more than one leave account and you want your employees to use one account before they can use another, you can adjust it here. Bank holiday calendar : If your portal has a holiday calendar set up, it is possible to link the calendar to the vacation account. Once your bank holiday calendar is associated, it will affect the cost for created/requested vacation. For example, an employee has requested time off from Monday to Friday (5 days). If Tuesday is a bank holiday, the suggested cost will be 4 days instead of 5 days.   Default Shift type for overlapping shifts:  You can select a Shift type here as a preselected option, which will make sure that, when approving Absence requests, the right Shift type will be pre-filled as the default Shift type. Remember to press  Save  before exiting.   Visibility of approved absence requests in the schedule When an employee has requested time off and you have approved it, this will be marked in the schedule.   Approved time off does not prevent you from scheduling an employee, but their name will be marked in red in the employee selector. If you assign a Shift to an employee during their time off, you will notice a red icon on that shift letting you know that you need to adjust the Schedule.   Additional settings Calculating day‚Äôs vacation in relation to weekday If you want a day's vacation to be calculated automatically in relation to a weekday, you'll need to specify the working hours per month in an employee's individual details (from  People  >  Employees  > edit employee >  Hrs per month ).    If your employee does not have a fixed requirement for working hours per month or if they are hourly paid, we recommend entering '1' and saving.  This also applies if the vacation should be deducted from PDF and Salary reports that you wish to generate.    In this case, the employee should have a value set both for Monthly salary and Hrs per month.    You can also set a Monthly salary and Hrs per month value of 1 if needed.   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For admins looking to integrate Fortnox with Planday. Set up Planday with Fortnox here  or see  Fortnox - FAQ and troubleshooting  guide. With the successful  integration of Fortnox , it is essential to maintain accurate and up-to-date employee and payroll information in both Planday and Fortnox. This article provides a comprehensive guide on effectively managing payroll, previewing payroll data, and synchronising it seamlessly with Fortnox. Managing payroll sync Settings checklist before you do a pay run To preview and send payroll data to Fortnox, you must ensure that the Fortnox  Cause codes   and   Planday   Salary codes  are linked. We recommend that you follow this settings checklist to make sure everything is in place. ‚ö†Ô∏è  When migrating from an existing integration based on export files You can skip this step if you are migrating from an integration based on PAXml file export/import to a setup not based on export files. Ensure that all the pay items are supported in the new integration. For instance, the OK0 (NV9 in PAXml file), OK1 (√ñK1 in PAXml file), and OK2 (√ñK2 in PAXml file) codes are different in the current configuration. If your employees are hourly paid, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  General  and check that the  Salary code  for  Hours worked (as per shifts)  field is set to  ARB .  If your employees are paid according to the number of hours from Approved Punch Clock entries:  make sure that you've  approved all the necessary Punch Clock entries  from  Schedule  >  Punch Clock  and that all shifts that you want to include in the payroll are approved (marked as green on your schedule). Note that by default, only approved hours are included in payroll reports. If your employees get a monthly salary , you must ensure that the worked hours from the schedule are excluded from their payroll calculations. To check whether the hours are already excluded, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Prints  and under  Ignore salary codes  check whether the Salary code for the monthly salaries is already on the list. You can add it from the  Create  button if it doesn't already exist.  Then, you will need to make sure that the newly created Salary code is attached to the profiles of your salary (monthly) paid employees. From  People  >  Employees  >  Edit employee  (‚úèÔ∏è icon on the right side of the screen) >  Employment  >  Employee group s >  Edit .   Here, you'll need to add the new Salary code to each employee group that your employee belongs to and select a date from when the code is valid on their profile (you should choose a date that is before the first pay run for the integration) and leave/set the Wage (hourly rate) as 0. Payroll supplements for unsociable hours If your organisation has a schedule that includes unsociable hours with payroll implications, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplements  and make sure that each supplement has the right Salary code set (e.g. OB1, OB2, OB3, etc).   Under  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Meal deductions and contributions,  check or add the Salary code  322  for deductions and  32  for contributions.  Additionally, make sure that the meal deductions have a positive value output Verify that your Shift types have the correct Cause codes attached from  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types  (e.g. SJK, VAB). Sync data into Fortnox cost centres If you wish to sync your labour costs to Fortnox with cost centre allocation, you must map your departments to relevant cost centres and then enable the functionality.    Start by enabling the cost centre functionality in the Fortnox integration. To enable the feature, navigate to  Settings  in Planday > click  Integrations  > open the  Fortnox  integration and select the  Include department number (Fortnox cost center)  checkbox.   Then copy-paste codes of your cost centres to corresponding departments in Planday (use the  Department number field ).   Preview Payroll data before syncing You can generate a payroll preview and synchronise your records (from Planday to Fortnox) for worked hours, overtime, absence, and supplements from  Payroll  >  Fortnox . Here, you can prepare and filter the data you want to preview or sync between the two systems through options available at the top of the screen: Fortnox account:  select one of your connected Fortnox accounts to sync payroll data to. Date range:  select the period for the pay run by selecting a date range. Department : select which Planday Department to gather payroll data for. Shifts:  select which shifts from the Schedule you'd like to preview or sync data for: only  Approved  Shifts (selected default and recommended when sync√≠ng payroll data),  only those not approved  or all Shifts from the selected date range. Employee type & Employee group:  this allows you to choose and filter which employee data to include using filters for Employee type and Employee group.  If necessary, you can select or deselect individual employees from both dropdown menus to filter for a single employee. Once you're satisfied with your selection, you can preview your data as a report from the top right corner (Preview report). This will   generate a report containing the data according to your filters and conditions for you to verify and sync. You cannot sync the selected data without first previewing it. When the report is ready, you can see an overview of your data, containing: the  names  of your employees (as registered in Planday), their  salary IDs  (equivalent of their employee ID in Fortnox), the number of worked  hours  (within the date range selected and according to the Shifts included).  For monthly paid employees this will show the number of hours recorded through special shift types ( e.g. overtime). total : showing as an  estimated pay  for hourly-paid employees  or  the  estimated differences  from the regular salary for monthly-paid employees (e.g. overtime, deductions, etc). For each Employee on the list, you can click on their entry in the overview list to see a brief breakdown of their recorded  hours  per shift type, and of their  total  per supplement and deduction type. You also have the option to check the data more thoroughly from Show details, which will give you a full picture of the payroll data: grouped by  Date : showing shifts - including breaks, supplements, and deductions related to that shift; and their start and end times, where applicable. Position:  highlighting   the Schedule Position of the shift, if applicable or name/details for breaks, supplements, and deductions. Quantity : showing the number of hours (except for daily supplements or deductions) Wage / Pay rate:  the rate per hour for shifts and hourly supplements or the rate per day for daily supplements or deductions Total:  the resulting monetary impact of the shift, break, supplement or deduction according to its set rate.   üí° In case you do not see certain shifts, shift types or supplements added to the preview, please review previous steps regarding updating salary codes or see  How to set up Salary codes in Planday .   Sync payroll data to Fortnox Once you've previewed and verified that the data is correct, press  Sync report  from the top right corner.   This will start cleaning up the payroll data from Fortnox (if there is any existing data for the selected date range) and transferring the selected data to Fortnox.  Depending on the amount of data in your report, this process can take a few moments.   Once the process is complete, you will get a confirmation message under  Sync status.  If you encounter any errors during the sync process, you will see a message about what went wrong. Double-check your data or follow the instructions on troubleshooting in this  Fortnox - FAQ and troubleshooting  article.   Need more help?

Written by  Sepideh   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ  For Admins. Looking for  All Gravy setup guide? Setup Q: What if I have more than one Planday account? A: If you have more than one Planday account (for instance, different restaurants, locations, etc.) you will need to create a new All Gravy account for each of the Planday accounts.   Further, you will need to connect each All Gravy account with Planday. Q: What is a Child Account? A: Some restaurants have a setup where they have multiple Planday accounts linked to one - in these cases you create 1 All Gravy account for each child account. Q: I just connected with Planday, but I can't my employees in the list yet? A: After connecting with Planday, it can take up to 2 minutes for it to import the employees. If you refresh your browser after 2 minutes, you should see the imported employees. Q: I can‚Äôt see my new employee(s) in All Gravy? A: All Gravy and Planday automatically update every hour on the hour, so should be available within 60 minutes. Q: When I‚Äôm setting up, I have to choose between ‚ÄúAll completed shifts‚Äù vs ‚ÄúAllow confirmed shifts‚Äù - what does that mean? A: This decides whether employees should be able to withdraw money as soon as a shift is completed, or first when it has been approved by a manager in Planday. Some companies approve shifts almost immediately after a shift has ended - in these cases, it makes sense to choose ‚ÄòAllow confirmed shifts‚Äô. ‚ÄúAll completed shifts‚Äù means that your employees can withdraw their salary as soon as the shift is completed in Planday - use this if you approve shifting frequently (more than 2 hours after the shift is done). Q: Which integrations do I need to get All Gravy to work? A: We have created all Gravy with the vision of an easy plug-and-play setup- so all you need is Planday and your payroll provider. We support almost everyone, including Zenegy, DataL√∏n, Danl√∏n, etc. Q: How long does it take to set All Gravy up? A: Integrating with Planday takes less than 10 minutes.   Admin work  Q: Does it take extra time to do salary when we have All Gravy? A: It should add about 5 minutes to your monthly payroll process. Q: Does All Gravy work with my payroll system? A: We currently support Zenegy, Danl√∏n, Datal√∏n, Intect.io, ProL√∏n, Lessor, and others. Contact us if you‚Äôre in doubt.   How does it work? Q: Is All Gravy a payroll provider? A: No, All Gravydoes not replace your payroll provider- we simply integrate between Planday and your payroll provider. Q: How does All Gravy know what the right tax is for my employees? A: Depending on your payroll provider, we either get the correct tax information directly from them or the employees themselves enter this into the app when onboarding - we have of course included a guide for them on how to find this. Q : How do we avoid double paying my employees? A: By integrating with your payroll system, we simply make sure that All Gravyon a monthly basis shares the withdrawals made in that payroll period with your payroll system. Q: What will it look like on my employee's salary slip? A: It will be registered as an ‚Äúaconto-udbetaling‚Äù (advancepayment) and will show on the salary slip as ‚ÄúAll Gravy Withdrawal‚Äù. Q: What does All Gravy do to our liquidity? Will it affect our liquidity? A: All Gravy provides the company with two possibilities: All Gravy provides liquidity:  We pay out the employees withdrawals from our bank account and invoice you monthly. You provide liquidity:  The customer pays a deposit, in which case we will take the employee‚Äôs withdrawals from that account and get the deposit refilled on a monthly basis.   Need more help?

If you have set up a Contract rule with multiple intervals, you can set one as primary so it is visible inside the schedule (week, month or year).     Next, enter the values for the Contract rule and Save. The start date set is the day and date from which the scheduled hours are counted. For example, if the start date is set to 1 June with an interval length of 1 week and 40 total hours, we can then expect that 40 hours should be worked from the 1st to the 7th, the 8th to the 14th, and so on. üí°  It is recommended to set the start date to a Monday for a weekly interval or to the 1st day of a month for a monthly interval. If certain  Shift types  should be excluded from the Contract rule, you can deselect them by going to Applies to > Shift types. The example below excludes training hours from the employees‚Äô weekly minimum hours.     How to assign a Contract rule to an Employee  To assign a Contract rule to an employee, go to the  People  page, hover on the employee‚Äôs name and select the pencil icon ‚úé to  edit .    From the  Personal details  tab, scroll down to the  Payroll  section where you can find the  Contract rule.   Select the required Contract rule from the drop-down menu and press  Save . Using Contract rules while scheduling When you navigate the schedule, you‚Äôll see a colour status on employees with a Contract rule set. The three different statuses described below indicate if the employee is on track to meet their contracted rules: üü¢ Green - The employee is scheduled for the correct amount of hours. üü° Yellow - The employee is not scheduled for enough hours. üî¥ Red - The employee is scheduled for too many hours. To show if an employee‚Äôs scheduled hours meet the requirements of their Contract rules, hover on the status icon next to their name. From there, you can see the deviation hours, which indicate the difference between the hours specified in the Contract rule compared to the scheduled hours for the employee.   Select the icon to see a more detailed overview of the Contract rule and to switch to different intervals if more than one has been set. üí°  Please note: The scheduled hours for an employee are calculated based on all assigned shifts within the interval date range across all departments. Breaks are subtracted, and if any shift types are excluded from the Contract rule, then shifts with this  Shift type  are also subtracted from the calculation.   Need more help?

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents üéØ For advanced admins. Familiarise yourself with the  Payroll and Revenue  collection of articles. What are Salary codes? Salary codes  in Planday are used to identify and report different shifts, mainly when you use accounting software to process your payroll. They help categorise the shifts and make managing and tracking payroll-related information easier. For example, you can use salary codes to differentiate regular working hours, overtime, sick leave, or any other specific types of shifts for accurate reporting and payroll calculations. When and where can you use Salary codes Salary codes have a hierarchy when placed in different areas of Planday. A general Salary code can be set for all normal Shifts that cover all the hours. This is sufficient under most circumstances.   A Salary code can also be set for each  Employee group . This will overrule the general code to differentiate Shifts belonging to that Employee group.   In rare cases, a Salary code can also be set on each employee's wage. This will overrule the general one and the one set on the Employee group level. üí°  Please keep Salary codes simple and avoid using special characters or punctuation marks, as that may interfere with your payroll integration service. You may use alphanumeric names, for example, Under18 or Full-time, but avoid using complex characters such !partTime&(u18*) ‚Ç¨FullTimer%100Pay. How to set a general Salary code You can set up a general   Salary code for all normal shifts simply by going to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  General.  Scroll down to the  Salary codes  section and set values for regular hourly worked shifts, monthly salaried shifts, or employee purchases.   üí°   If no value has been inserted in the fields above, the default salary code for Hours worked (as per shifts) is 1201 and for Salary, it‚Äôs 1202. These would show in the payroll report. How to set a Salary code on Shift types Another place you can assign Salary codes is on specific  Shift types . This is helpful when you want to distinguish hours as overtime, unpaid leave, sick, or absence.    Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types,  click on an existing Shift type to  edit  and add a Salary code to override the one set in general settings.   In the following example, you can see that all Shifts marked with overtime of 1.5x will be reported under Salary code 1500 so that the payroll software can distinguish those hours from the regular hours. üí° Note that Planday only reports the hours for that Shift type, not the rate. Apply Salary codes to Employee groups Setting up Salary codes for  Employee groups  can be helpful if you want to differentiate the hours for a group of employees or job roles. For example, employees in a clinic need to be paid a different wage than when they work in the reception vs other administrative roles. You could set a Salary code for the Employee group to differentiate Shifts belonging to these employees.   Go to  People  >  Employee groups.  You can add a Salary code to a new group or edit an existing one. The Salary codes set here will override the one set in the  g eneral settings.   Assign a Salary code to an employee There might be situations where you need to differentiate a single employee's hours separate from the rest of the group. For example, an employee may be paid a different rate due to their seniority in the company, so their hours need to be reported separately in payroll. Setting an individual salary code for this employee would be the way to go, so it overrides the general Salary code and any of the group rates. Go to  People  >  Employees  > click the  edit  employee button on an employee you wish to change > switch to the  Employment  tab > scroll down to  Employee groups  >  Edit . You can assign a personal Salary code to this employee by editing their Employee group relation. üí° For scalability, we generally don't recommend applying a Salary code on the employee level but use it through  Employee groups  instead.

Where can I find my invoices? You can access the Account area by going to your  profile  on the top right corner of the screen >  Account  >  Invoices . Here you can see a list of all your past invoices that you can download as files in PDF format.   Invoices are also sent to the email address registered to receive them for your account, regardless of which payment option you use.   What is included in my invoice? An invoice is addressed to the billing address you have provided.  Under  Details , you will find the invoice number, date, customer number and due date on the right-hand side.  Below, you will find a list of cost items with subscription and user fees. If you use the SMS features,  SMS charges will be listed here . If you have not set up an automatic payment option, you can transfer the amount due to the account indicated at the bottom of the invoice. How does the billing for user fees work? In Planday, users (employees) are billed in increments of  five  according to the  Terms and Conditions : If you have six users, your bill will be calculated for ten user licenses.   If you add more employees to Planday, your invoices will automatically reflect this. The same applies if you reduce the number. You are not billed for deactivated employees. This means you must deactivate employees before the last day of your billing period for the reduction to be reflected in the subsequent bill. üí°  Minimum of 5 users are charged in the Starter package, a minimum of 10 users in the Plus package (Minimum limit reduced from 20 to 10 for subscriptions signed up from 10 May 2023), and a minimum of 50 in the Pro package. If you have annual billing and need to report a user count increase, please email: Unexpected costs are appearing on my bill. What is the reason for this? Users fee  - Note that users are charged in increments of 5. For more information,  see the notes above . Additional users  - This cost item refers to users from the previous billing period that will be back billed. For example, in your March invoice, you had been charged for 20 users. On 15 March, you added 10 more (active) employees. Therefore, in the invoice for April, you will be retroactively charged for these 10 users from 15 - 31 March. You will also be charged for 30 users from the April invoice.  Note:  If you deactivate employees in a billing period that has already been billed, the billing will not change retroactively. The number of active employees at the beginning of the billing period will be charged for the next bill - regardless of the number of active employees in the previous billing period. SMS charges  - If you use SMS functions (e.g. sending reminders or notifications), the SMS rates of Planday's mobile service provider apply according to your contract. The cost as of 05/23 is ‚Ç¨0.08 plus VAT per SMS. If you have questions about this, feel free to email: If you have any further questions, don't hesitate to contact us by email at: Please remember to include your invoice or customer number contacting us via email.   How can I change the address on my Planday invoices? Please include your company name, customer number, and the desired new billing address in the email and send it to: How can I change the name of my company on the invoices? Please include your company name, customer number, and the desired new changes in the email and send it to: If the VAT or commercial register numbers have changed, outgoing and incoming parties must sign a  Novation Agreement . For this, Planday needs the following details from both parties: Name of the company Trade register number / VAT. ID number Registered company address Full name and contact e-mail address of the owner or authorised signatory. Please also provide the new billing e-mail address.   Once all information is submitted, Planday will create a  Novation Agreement  and forward it to all parties to sign electronically. The changes will be implemented after the signature. üí°  Novation is a replacement of a contract's party or obligation with a new one. The new party takes on the obligation of the original party and is completely releasing the former party of that obligation. The novation agreement must be signed by the transferor, the transferee, and the counterparty (the other contracting party). What happens if I have not paid an invoice? In this case, we will send you payment reminders to the e-mail address registered with your account. You will receive these reminders approximately 8 and 16 days after the invoice due date.   After the second reminder is sent to you, administrators will see an alert in Planday informing them that there are outstanding payments and a due date before a payment must be made before your Planday account will be blocked.   What can I do if my Planday account has been blocked? In this case, please contact the support team by emailing them at:  They will be able to explain the reason for the block, let you know which invoices are awaiting payment, and what steps are necessary to remove the block.

This article highlights what you need to know to keep your records in Planday accurate if you have scheduled shifts that overlap daylight saving time changes. When does DST start this year? DST transition for the winter to summer seasons can occur at different dates around the year across the globe. This year, the changes will occur on the following days: EU countries & the UK US & Canada Australia & New Zealand 31 March 2024 10 March 2024 1 October 2023 The time adjustment usually occurs on the last Sunday of March. The time adjustment usually happens on the second Sunday of March. The time adjustment usually occurs on the first Sunday of October . For other regions, you can find more information on  TimeAndDate.com   When the  DST period begins , the clocks  advance one hour  during the warmer months. Practically, this means that on the date when the DST period begins, the clock will instantly advance by one hour (for instance, when the clock strikes 01:00 am, it would immediately become 02:00 am instead. So, on this date, the hour between 01:00 and 01:59:59  disappears  in any given time zone). üí° Please note that the exact time for the clock adjustment depends on the time zone of your country, and it can be different from the example given above.

What does this mean for you, and how to make adjustments in Planday The DST practice can have different implications for managing your organisation in Planday. It depends on your policies and the country where you conduct your operations. The following fixes only apply if you have night shift employees working at a time that crosses over a DST change. ‚ö†Ô∏è  Planday does not support automatic DST adjustments  for shift duration. If you need to switch to DST, you must check and manually correct your  payroll  and  schedule. Check and  edit the shift duration  for the shifts that overlap with the DST. As the clock changes forward (and one hour will be  removed ), you should ensure that the shift duration remains correct.    For example, a shift starting at 10:00 pm and ending at 04:00 am should account for six payable hours. If scheduled on a DST start day, it should account for five rather than six hours. For this overlapping shift, you must  manually   decrease the length  to correctly account for the actual worked hours (remove one hour).   Check your payroll data  to ensure no discrepancy or miscalculation in the number of hours worked for the date when daylight saving time changes occurred. If your payroll data depends on approved shifts and, by extension, on the duration of those shifts, making sure that the shift duration is correct should also be enough to correct your payroll data.   Remember to also communicate any changes to your employees to ensure that everyone is on the same page and avoids confusion.   Need more help?

If you need to switch from DST, you must check and manually correct the affected shifts on the  Schedule  by  increasing  the shift duration or adjusting the  Punch Clock entries  by adding an hour. Check and  edit the shift duration  for the shifts that overlap with the DST. As the clock changes backwards (and one hour will  occur twice ), you should ensure that the shift duration remains correct.    For example, if a shift starts at 10:00 pm and ends at 04:00 am, it should account for six payable hours. But, if it's scheduled on a DST end date and we gain an hour, you'll need to  manually increase this shift  until 05:00 am, or adjust the Punch Clock entry, so that it accounts for seven hours instead of six.     Check your payroll data  to ensure no discrepancy or miscalculation in the number of hours worked for the date when daylight saving time changes occurred. If your payroll data depends on approved shifts and, by extension, on the duration of those shifts, making sure that the shift duration is correct should also be enough to correct your payroll data.   Remember to also communicate any changes to your employees to ensure that everyone is on the same page and avoids confusion. Need more help?

If you do not see this option as a manager, have your Planday admin assign you  higher access . Leave balances How can I export leave balances? Export the available balance of your employees‚Äô leave accounts by going to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or  Absence accounts ).  Adjust the  period  to have the right balance. Select the  account status In the  Filters , choose which  Departments ,  Employee groups ,  Employee types  and  Leave accounts  you want to extract the report for. Then click on  Export  in the top right corner   How can I view the overall accrued balances? You can view them under  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence account).   The accrued balance might appear lower than you expect. This is because the start of the period is set by default to the first day of the current month and not the start date of the spending or accruing period of the account.    In order to see the overall accrued and used balances you need to change the period to the start date of the accruing period until today‚Äôs date.   In the example above, the start date of the period is set to the first day of the current month and the balance accrued only shows 0.12 days. By changing the start date of the period to the day when the employee should start accruing days and setting the end date of the period to today‚Äôs date, the employee has accrued 3.98 days. If no end date is selected, the system will take into account the  end date of the spending period  of the account. In the leave template‚Äôs settings under  Settings > Leave & Overtime > Account templates , if you‚Äôve chosen the requirements for accrual to ‚ÄúNo requirements, always accrue‚Äù,   you‚Äôll be able to see an  estimation of the overall hours/days accrued  at the end of the accruing period in the leave account overview.   Why is the available balance of an absence account different than expected? Suppose one of your employees has taken many holiday days. However, the available balance in the overview under  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence accounts) is higher than you would expect. It could be that there are holidays approved in the future, and the period you selected in the overview doesn‚Äôt cover future holidays.  You would therefore need to change the period end date or remove it completely to have the correct available balance.   The account balance you see depends on the selected period. See this example on Available balance before changing the period:   Available balance after changing the period:   Why can‚Äôt I see the initial account balance of a future absence account? If you‚Äôre using automatic renewal of accounts and you have a fixed account whose validity date is set in the future, the start balance of this account will show 0 it‚Äôs because the period's start date is set to a date before the validity date of the account.  You would then need to match the period's start date to the account's start date.   Why is the available balance different on the app than on the web? On the app, the available balance will include both the approved holiday and the unapproved holiday but if you press on the account, you'll see a detail of:  the balance to date (includes the approved holiday but doesn‚Äôt include the unapproved holiday) and the available balance (includes both the approved and the unapproved holiday)    I‚Äôve deactivated an employee and I must pay their remaining holiday balance. How do I do that? You can export a leave account report. To do this, follow these steps: Go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence accounts) Set the dates in the period filter from the start of the accruing period to the day the employee is deactivated Click on  Filters  and choose the holiday account Click on  Export The final column  Leave pay - at the end day of the period filter  in the export will give you the amount to pay.    It‚Äôs advised to delete their future holiday in order to get an accurate figure of the accrued leave that they are owed in their final pay. To do so, go to  Schedule  >  Absence requests  (or  Leave requests ) > Adjust the period filter > Choose the statuses  Approved  and  Pending  > Find the leave requests > Edit them and click on  Deny .   Leave requests How can I export my employees' leave requests? Export your employees‚Äô overall leave requests for a selected period under  Schedule  >  Leave requests ( or  Absence requests)  > click  Export.  You'll then be able to choose the date range you want to look at, the type of account (either accrued or TOIL) and the departments you want the report for. Why can‚Äôt one of my employees submit a leave request? It could be because of one of these reasons: Does the employee have an active absence account? To check this, go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence accounts) > enter the employee‚Äôs name in the search bar > select the  Active  filter in  Account status  and select the account‚Äôs current period. If no account appears, you need to  assign one to the employee first  (no absence request can be submitted without an absence account. If the employee already has an active leave account assigned, another reason is that there is another request that overlaps. You can check this under  Schedule  >  Leave requests  (or Absence requests). If there is another request,  reject it first  before a new one can be submitted. Why can‚Äôt I see all of an employee‚Äôs leave requests in the Leave Overview tab in the employee‚Äôs profile? It‚Äôs probably because the wrong time frame is selected.   ‚ö†Ô∏è  The start of the period is set by default to the first day of the current month.   To see all of an employee‚Äôs leave requests change the start date of the period to the date the account is valid.   How can I make sure the leave requests go to the right manager? Let's assume an admin has access to a specific department and should only be notified when an employee in the same department requests leave. You can achieve this by using the  supervisor feature . Is it possible to book a holiday even if you have not accrued the hours? Yes, it's possible if you have enabled the option  Allow negative balance   in the Absence account template's settings.   Inactive accounts How do I delete Leave accounts / Account templates? You can delete a Leave account template by going to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  >  Account templates . Select the relevant account template from the list and click on  Delete . If you only delete the account template, this will not delete the leave accounts created from it, but they‚Äôll become inactive.  Keep in mind that deleting an account template may result in the loss of all associated data.   You can delete a Leave account by going to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts . In the account row, select the delete icon on the far right.    You must first have processed all pending requests before deleting an account. I reactivated some employees but I can‚Äôt book holidays on their leave account. What do I do? When you deactivate an employee, their leave account is automatically deactivated and you can‚Äôt change the accruing and spending periods nor request a holiday on it.  You would need to reach out to our support team so they can help you make some changes to this account or  assign a new Leave account  to the employee. I reactivated some employees but on a different contract. What do I do with their Absence accounts? You would need to apply a new account and set the start date for accruing to the start date of the contract otherwise, the system will take the hiring date of the employee.     Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago üéØ  For admins new to Planday.  Get to know the  desktop schedule here . Various levels of structure are available in Planday for organising your company and your employees. In this article, you'll learn more about these levels, the most essential elements that constitute them and how they can be used to structure your business.   In Planday, your business and the organisation of your employees can be structured into  Departments  and  Employee groups .    The scheduling functionality has additional subdivisions into  Sections ,  Positions ,  Shifts  and  Shift   types . You can see this overview in the illustration below, with an example screenshot at the end of the article. Department : A department is a workplace unit often created for each company's physical location. Each department has its separate schedule in Planday.  Example: Restaurant Northport, Restaurant Eastend.  Learn more in the  Create and edit Departments  article.   Employee group : This level indicates in which role or function an employee works. You can manage an employee in several Employee groups, provided the qualifications allow it.  Example: waiter, receptionists, cooks etc.  Learn more in the  Create and edit Employee groups  article. As an additional unit, you can also consider creating  Employee   types,  for  example, permanent employees, part-timers and interns . This can help distribute  Payroll supplements  or allocate  Contract rules . Learn more in the  Create and edit Employee types  article.   Section : Several positions on the schedule can be grouped in a category to indicate different workplace activity areas‚Äîfor  example, First floor, Front desk etc.   Position : A position can specify what an employee is responsible for during their shift. Example:  Service tables 1-10.  Learn more about points 3 and 4 in the article  Scheduling with Positions and Sections .   Shift : A shift is used to specify an employee's working hours on the schedule. Each shift can be assigned to a maximum of one employee. Learn more in the  Create, edit ,  move, copy, and delete shifts  article.   Shift type : Shift types allow you to specify special features of shifts, separating them from regular shifts.  Examples: No shows / Overtime / Trial shifts etc.  Learn more in the  Creating and Using Shift types  article.   Example: Structure of Planday in practice The following illustration shows an example use of the structure of Planday with a fictional clinic setup. When applied to a Planday schedule, this example structure can be seen in the following way. The screenshot shows a fictional  UK Clinic  schedule as  (1.) Department .   Some shifts have been applied to the  Nurses   (2.) Employee group  in  Daylight Ops   (3.) Section . Employees will work in  Clinic room A   (4.) Positions .   While  Thompson Flash  has a normal  (5.) Shift  from 07:00 to 15:00,  Mary Jane  is there at the same time for training work  (6.) Shift type is applied.   Each company and its organisation of workforce is unique. When setting up Planday, you can choose how to leverage the structure based on your operational needs. See the screenshot above as an example. Especially in the setup phase of Planday, it is worth reading this article to get a better overview.   üí° To dig even deeper into scheduling, you will find the article  Get to know the desktop Schedule  and the collection of articles on scheduling helpful.

Planday will only send the date range of holidays taken to Xero, as we currently cannot send hours/days of holidays or the monetary value, therefore any payment or balances will be managed from within Xero. For any questions on how to add absence in Xero please contact the Xero support team or your Account Manager at Xero. Once you have selected the existing Xero earning rates and leave types that you wish to add to Planday so you can manually map them, press  Save .  As a final step, press  Save  and then  Activate  to enable your integration and make it available for Payroll. You can see the status of activated integration in your portal. You should have the option to export to Xero under  Payroll > Xero Payroll  (Refresh your page if you don‚Äôt see the updated menu option).

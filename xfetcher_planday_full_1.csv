Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago 🎯  For admins new to Planday.  Get to know the  desktop schedule here . Various levels of structure are available in Planday for organising your company and your employees. In this article, you'll learn more about these levels, the most essential elements that constitute them and how they can be used to structure your business.   In Planday, your business and the organisation of your employees can be structured into  Departments  and  Employee groups .    The scheduling functionality has additional subdivisions into  Sections ,  Positions ,  Shifts  and  Shift   types . You can see this overview in the illustration below, with an example screenshot at the end of the article. Department : A department is a workplace unit often created for each company's physical location. Each department has its separate schedule in Planday.  Example: Restaurant Northport, Restaurant Eastend.  Learn more in the  Create and edit Departments  article.   Employee group : This level indicates in which role or function an employee works. You can manage an employee in several Employee groups, provided the qualifications allow it.  Example: waiter, receptionists, cooks etc.  Learn more in the  Create and edit Employee groups  article. As an additional unit, you can also consider creating  Employee   types,  for  example, permanent employees, part-timers and interns . This can help distribute  Payroll supplements  or allocate  Contract rules . Learn more in the  Create and edit Employee types  article.   Section : Several positions on the schedule can be grouped in a category to indicate different workplace activity areas—for  example, First floor, Front desk etc.   Position : A position can specify what an employee is responsible for during their shift. Example:  Service tables 1-10.  Learn more about points 3 and 4 in the article  Scheduling with Positions and Sections .   Shift : A shift is used to specify an employee's working hours on the schedule. Each shift can be assigned to a maximum of one employee. Learn more in the  Create, edit ,  move, copy, and delete shifts  article.   Shift type : Shift types allow you to specify special features of shifts, separating them from regular shifts.  Examples: No shows / Overtime / Trial shifts etc.  Learn more in the  Creating and Using Shift types  article.   Example: Structure of Planday in practice The following illustration shows an example use of the structure of Planday with a fictional clinic setup. When applied to a Planday schedule, this example structure can be seen in the following way. The screenshot shows a fictional  UK Clinic  schedule as  (1.) Department .   Some shifts have been applied to the  Nurses   (2.) Employee group  in  Daylight Ops   (3.) Section . Employees will work in  Clinic room A   (4.) Positions .   While  Thompson Flash  has a normal  (5.) Shift  from 07:00 to 15:00,  Mary Jane  is there at the same time for training work  (6.) Shift type is applied.   Each company and its organisation of workforce is unique. When setting up Planday, you can choose how to leverage the structure based on your operational needs. See the screenshot above as an example. Especially in the setup phase of Planday, it is worth reading this article to get a better overview.   💡 To dig even deeper into scheduling, you will find the article  Get to know the desktop Schedule  and the collection of articles on scheduling helpful.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and Schedule Managers. See a list of all  video tutorials on Wistia  or see  tutorials for employees here . This article will show you how to configure different parts of Planday by taking you through short guided video tutorials.   Getting Started How to log in to Planday from a web browser or the Planday app You need to have three pieces of information to log in to Planday. Planday URL:  This is the URL you will need to go to on the web version to log in to Planday.  Username:  This would be the  email address  you received the initial email invitation. Password:  The password you set up by clicking the confirmation sent in your email. You and everyone on your team will use these three items to log in on both the app and web versions of Planday.   How to create, edit or delete Departments Use  Departments  to separate different work areas and keep your schedules organized and efficient. Departments can also be different locations of your business or separate areas within your company, each with its schedule and employees.    How to create Employee groups In Planday, you can use  Employee groups  to describe a job, a role or a function (for example waiter, receptionist, cashier). Employee groups hold the pay rate for the employee and allow employees to work in multiple roles. They are also needed to create  Positions  on the schedule.   How to create, edit and invite employees Populating Planday with your employees is essential to getting your schedule up and running.  Create employees  by filling in their data. Assign new employees to one or more Departments and add them to Employee groups. Finally, invite your staff to Planday and give them access to the schedule.   How to schedule Assuming you have created Departments, created job roles in Employee groups, and invited a group of employees to Planday, it is time to bring it together. You can go to the  Schedule  page and  create shifts  for your employees.    Using Planday How to create and use Schedule templates Schedule templates  are the next stage of scheduling and allow you to plan and schedule weeks in advance. By creating a default schedule template, using a mixture of assigned and open shifts, you can create a flexible template that can be applied up to 14 times in one go. This will reduce your scheduling time and allow you to plan more effectively, giving you and your employees a clear view of who is working.   How to set up Open shifts Open shifts  in your schedule are shifts that are not yet assigned to a specific employee but are available to be requested by employees. You can set the start and end time, select the particular Employee group and position, define the kind of shift you know you need to fill, and leave it open. The shift will show as a placeholder on the schedule. Your employees can then request to take this available shift if they match the Department and Employee group required by the  Shift type .   How to troubleshoot logging in to Planday  ⚠️ One of the most common issues for logging in for new employees is that the email (username) is misspelt or incorrect. Follow the instructions in the article  Updating Usernames (email)  to correct it. Is Punch Clock asking for an  Activation code ? It may be that the device you are using to Punch in is not on the approved Wi-Fi address or your dynamic IP has changed. Ensure that your device is on the correct Wi-Fi network. Follow the instructions to  check and update your registered IP address . For employees:  What you can do if you have problems with the Punch Clock If you are having difficulties logging in, there's most likely an error with one of these details.   How to configure an employee form setup Each employee has a customizable profile that you can fill out or have the employee fill in. If you need to add more sections to hold more details than the standard fields, you can edit the setup form  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup  and add  additional fields .   How to assign hourly wages to Employees  On Planday, it is possible to set up the  hourly wage  of multiple employees (with the same rate and valid from the same date) at the same time from the Employee Groups page. Wages are set in the Employee group and thus attached to employees belonging to that group. This allows employees to belong to multiple groups but have different pay rates per group if necessary. Wages can also be assigned individually or set to apply from a specific date automatically by editing the Employee profile under the Employment tab.   How to set fixed salaries for your employees Salaries  differ from wages as they do not rely on shift data. A salary is a fixed amount based on a pay period paid monthly by default. You can choose the allocation method for the salary cost distribution across your schedule, giving you an estimate of what a fixed-salary person will cost you per day or hour.   How to communicate with staff via Planday messaging Within Planday, you can communicate with your staff directly through  messages  without relying on external social media groups or communication tools such as Whatsapp. You can send a message to a specific employee, an Employee group, an entire department, or across your organization. Employees will receive an in-app notification informing them they have a message waiting for them. You can share information through the Newsfeed and the Events tab to update your staff on general issues. You can also force an answer should you require a reply from your employees.   How to assign access levels and give employees additional roles By setting  Access levels  you can let some employees have additional access to Planday functions to perform managerial tasks. By default, there are three access levels in Planday:  Schedule Manager ,  People/HR Manager , and  Admin . An optional Account admin role gets assigned to an admin that signed up for Planday. The access areas for each access level can be seen in this  article .    How to set up the Punch Clock The Punch Clock allows you to bridge the gap between paying for the scheduled time and precise worked time. Punch Clock can be set up in a number of ways: For  clocking in from the web  on a PC or tablet with pre-defined IP addresses or Wi-Fi For punching in using the  Planday app within a specified geo-location For punching in from a physical location as a  standalone Kiosk app How to edit and approve Punch Clock entries Once you have started using Punch Clock, you must edit or  approve the Punch Clock entries  as they come. Approving worked times marks the corresponding shift as ready for payroll (green) and updates the schedule with the approved times for that shift. Once approved, the entries cannot be edited, and approved times are used for payroll.     Advance features How to configure automatic breaks Automatic breaks  take the trouble out of making deductions for break time. By creating a Break rule, you can set a pause interval to automatically appear on a shift that goes over a certain length on your schedule.   How to create and use Shift types The most common use for  Shift types  is recording sickness on the schedule and reporting this data for payroll reports. Shift types can also be used to change shift rates or add supplements. This is handy when paying different rates for evening or weekend shifts.   How to run reports on Shift types Once shifts on the schedule have a specific Shift type, you can go to  Reports > Shift type statistics  for a  report based on utilising these Shift types . For example, you could run a report to see the ratio between reported sickness and worked shifts.   How to set up Contracted availability Contracted availability  lets you see the hours you have obliged with an employee. This will let you see the specific contracted times or days an employee should be available for work. Having availability information will allow you to schedule the right people for the correct times matching their work availability. Contracted availability can be set up individually by editing an employee's account.   How to create a schedule using Positions and Sections  Positions and sections  allow you to plan your schedule when filling a shift with the right employee is more important than all employees having a shift. Scheduling in the Positions view provides flexibility, highlighting your schedule gaps by position instead of by staff.   How to configure revenue You can compare  Revenue  data against your Scheduled costs to highlight salary percentages or make other cost comparisons. Revenue can be added manually to the Planday by going to  Settings > Reports > Revenue . You can also set up forecasts and budgets to ensure you meet your goals and make changes to the schedule if you see things going over budget.   How to set up Contracts for electronic signatures You can send out  Contracts  or any documents your employees need to sign through Planday. Employees cannot add information to these Documents; they can only sign them. These files are saved on their profile and can be reviewed later. Signing contracts can be anything from employment terms, promotions in salary, work equipment loans, handing out keys or anything where you need an agreement from any employee.   How to set up Contract rules The  Contract rules  feature a scheduling tool that allows you to track the number of scheduled working hours for an employee. A red, orange, or green indicator appears around the employee's profile picture on the schedule to highlight potential scheduling issues. Contract rules can also be used for managing Flex/Overtime accounts.   How to generate a payroll report You can use the  Payroll export  function to quickly generate a payroll report in Excel, PDF or your preferred payroll integration system such as Sage 50, QuickBooks online and more. Approve existing worked hours and take action on pending leave requests before going for a pay run. See  what to prepare before creating a payroll report .   How to set up the Auto-schedule feature Auto-schedule  allows you to automate your scheduling to make it even easier to schedule more efficiently. You will need specific information in the system to ensure auto-scheduling runs effectively, such as Working time rules, Contracted availability, Contract rules, and at least 12 weeks' worth of previous scheduling data. 💡 If you want to try this Pro/Enterprise-only feature, please contact our support team.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and HR Managers. Skip this step if you manage contracts outside Planday and  wish to send an existing contract to an employee. With the contract module in Planday, you can build or upload contracts directly in Planday and use data from the employee information to personalise the contracts. That way, you only need to create one contract per  Employee type ,  group  or  Department  and can send personal contracts to your new hires using the merge fields function. This guide covers the following topics to create or upload a contract.   Go to  Settings  >  People  >  Contract set-up  and press  Create  to set up a contract template.   Create a contract using Planday text editor Start by giving a unique  name  to the contract. Choose which Employee groups can use this contract and set a category for this contract (optional).   Type  The  Insert text  function allows you to type the content of your contract directly into the text editor. You can use the text editor to stylize your contract and use employee data from your Planday to fill in certain fields.   The  Import Document  function allows you to upload an existing Microsoft Word document with the correct layout according to your company’s layout and use employee data from your Planday to fill in certain fields.   Merge Fields  No matter the type of contract you create, you can automatically merge each employee's information into the contract using  merge fields .    You can find a list of available merge fields   in the section below the text box with example data associated with the employee. See this  detailed document on merge fields  describing each value and their equivalent Danish values in case your Planday was set up in another language.    If entered into Planday’s editor, note that the merge fields should be spelt as they are in Planday. Be sure to use  < >  if using Planday text editor or remove < > if using Microsoft Word to compose your contract. Any custom data fields that you may have created, such as  visa information ,  COVID compliance , will have a  custom_  prefix to them and can be used in the contract.    💡 If you are missing a merge field,   create a new field  for the employee information page by going to  Settings  >  People >  Employee form setup . Once you have created a new field, it will appear on the employee's profile. Then enter a value in this field before using the merge field.   Upload   file Logo  (This option only appears if selecting the Insert text function) If you have chosen to compose your text in the Planday text editor, you can import a company logo and embed it into the digital contract with the option to position it.   Document  (This option only appears if selecting the Import document function) This allows you to upload an existing *.doc document with your layout and text. We recommend the file be in Word format so you can use the  merge fields  and thus get the most out of the contract module in Planday. See the complete list of  predefined merge fields here.   Generate test contract   If you want to see how the contract looks, you can preview it by  generating a test contract . This test contract fetches data from your profile and shows you what the contract may look like for the employee using your information.   Import your document using merge fields in Microsoft Word If you want to include information from Planday in your self-managed contracts, such as employee and company information, then you must choose  Import document  for  Type . This lets you import your company’s contract into Planday and customise it for your employee.    ⚠️ Note: The following examples use Microsoft Word for macOS, and these steps may differ slightly in other Word versions or on Windows.    To add Planday information to your external contract, open your contract in  Word  and create a new merge field. You can do that by going to the  Insert  menu and pressing the  Insert a Field  button or the menu bar in  Word  >  Insert  >  Field.   Inside  All  categories, look for  MergeField  from the list and select it (you can press “m” twice after selecting All to jump to the MergeFrield quickly). You can now enter the name of the field you wish to merge with the employee’s data  with its corresponding value from Planday . Be sure  not  to include < or > in your value.   To add more merge fields, copy and paste an existing merge field and then rename it according to the following instructions (or see the animation below): Double-click / right-click on the object and select  Toggle Field Codes . You can name the new field accordingly before updating (double-click / right-click on the object and select the  Update field ). You should copy the merge field from Planday and paste it into Word instead of entering it manually to minimize errors. Remember to save. After this, the field will appear in the contract template in Word and you can upload the contract file in Planday. Once all the desired merge fields have been created and the contract template has been uploaded to the system, you are ready to send it to your employees.

How to edit an existing Employee group You can edit the Employee group from the People page or navigate to  People  >  Employee groups .

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For advanced admins. If you’d like to see examples of Payroll supplements and how to use them, go to  Payroll Supplements – Use Cases . You can create payroll supplements to automatically adjust employees’ hourly rates or salaries based on set criteria. For example, you may want to pay your employees overtime if they work more than 10 hours during the day by using a  normal supplement . You may want to pay your employees double on certain holidays using a  day-based supplement . Or based on their  Contract type  some employees should be allocated a percentage of their hourly rate if they work on the weekends. How to create a Payroll supplement First, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement.   Here, you’ll have the option to create different kinds of supplements.  If you click on the  Create  button under  Payroll supplement,  several options will be available from the drop-down menu:   1. Choose the type of supplement Supplement type : Normal Supplements, Week Based Supplement, Day Based Supplement and Contract rules supplement. Title : Name of the supplement. Description : Include a description (optional).   2. Define when the supplement should apply Based on the chosen Payroll supplement, different options will determine when should the supplement apply after how many hours at what time of the day and if it should be a monetary increase or a percentage increase. See  Payroll Supplements – Use Cases  to learn more.    3. Define what days it should be applied and when it should be valid Days of the week : Select which days of the week the supplement should be applicable. Days from Bank Holiday calendar : Choose specific days from the  Bank Holiday calendar  in the system. Valid from/to : Set when the supplement comes into effect or ends.   4. Set filters defining who the supplement should apply to Employee groups : Select which  Employee groups  are eligible for the supplement. Employee types : Select which  Employee types  are eligible for the supplement. Shift types : This option allows you to define to which Shift types the Payroll supplement should apply. Contact our support team if you want to enable this option on your Planday.   5. Enable additional settings Affects salaried employees : If selected, the supplement will also affect those with a fixed salary rather than an hourly rate. This may not work with percentage-based supplements. Affected by breaks : If there is a break in the shift, should the break affect the shift time and therefore the total amount of time being affected by the supplement. Select this option if the supplement shouldn’t be paid during break periods. Enforced payment : Enable this to ensure that the supplement is always added to the pay – even though other supplements are present in the same period of the shift. If you don't select this option and two supplements are applied to an employee at the same time, only the one with the highest value will be given. Allow over midnight : Select if a shift goes over midnight, potentially into a day not selected as being covered by a supplement, should the supplement continue to apply on the hours that fall in the next day after midnight. Overview of different Payroll supplements in Planday Normal supplement Normal supplements are used when an employee’s pay rate should be adjusted at a certain time of the day, or after a specified amount of hours into a shift. You can set the increase or decrease in pay rate based on a percentage of a wage, or as a set monetary value. For example, full-time employees should be paid an additional 50% of their normal wage after 8.5 hours of work. Week-based supplement Week-based supplements are used to apply a supplement after a set number of hours worked in a week. For example, you can create a week-based supplement that will apply an additional 50% of an employee’s normal wage after 40 hours have been worked in a single week. Day-based supplement Day-based supplements are used when employees work more than one shift per day. The day-based supplement will account for all hours worked during the day. For example, if an employee works more than 9 hours in a single day, they get time and a half for each hour worked over 9 hours. Manual supplement These supplements are used when you manually want to add supplements to your employees, such as bonuses. It applies directly to the shift in the schedule. You can set a fixed amount per shift or per hour.   Contract rules supplement A Contract rules supplement can be applied to all employees that have a specific contract rule to pay them automatically any overtime supplements. For this type of supplement to work, you should already have  contract rules set up  for different employee types under  Settings  >  Contract rules  >  Create Contract rule.  This governs how many hours an employee should be working and lets you see and compare if they go beyond the contracted hours in the schedule and pay them a supplement.   Personal supplement You can set a fixed amount that your employees can get on a monthly basis.  For example, an employee receives a bonus for being a team leader in a busy period. Seniority supplement Seniority supplements can be added to the original pay rate, either monthly, bimonthly, daily or hourly after a certain length of employment. You can set up a required employment length and the number of days the supplement should be added. Time supplement This is especially relevant for employees who work on bank holidays.  For example, employees can get a time supplement of 150% or 200% on bank holidays. This time compensation is added to their TOIL (Overtime) account. Ifthe option  % (overtime)  is used in the dropdown under Hourly wage when you create a Normal supplement, the Time supplement will show in the section Time supplement.

Fill out the employee details and press  Create employee  button to finish.     Bulk create employees 💡  This function is under development. If you need help, you will receive this in your onboarding, or you can send a message to the support team. If you have many employees to import into Planday, creating several staff members in bulk is a suitable alternative to  creating employees individually . To do this, go to  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Employee import via template .   The more extensively you have already set up Planday with Departments, Employee groups, Employee types & contract conditions, the more effective the bulk import will be.   You can press  Insert rows  to add multiple employees directly to Planday via this interface.   Alternatively, you can press  Download template  and fill in the provided Excel document with details of your employees. Once complete, you can upload this via the Import option. Select the template data format to view the format needed for Planday to read your employee data. Enter your employee data in the following format in your Excel file. The fields email address, name, gender and department are mandatory fields. Leave the structure of the template unchanged - do not delete or add any rows. If you want an employee to be assigned to a department, put an X in the corresponding field. If you want an employee to be assigned to an Employee group, enter a number for the hourly wage (e.g. ""12"" for 12.00 €) or a 0 in the corresponding field. Bank account can be written as the registration number and the account number separated by a space or / For example 1234 567890 or 1234 / 567890 Dropdown : In the columns containing lists, the value you enter must match an element value found in the list. For example, in the gender column, you can enter Male or Female. Check box : If a tick box needs to be ticked, enter either ‘Yes’ or ‘X’. Phone/Mobile:  If you want the number to match a specific country, the value you enter must start with +[country code], e.g. +44 for the UK. It is only possible to use the country codes already in the list. Once you have entered all the data, save the file and import it via  Import  button and follow the steps.   Edit employee details from the People section on the web There are two ways to edit the details of an employee in the People section; quick edit and full edit.   1. Quick edit The quick edit method allows you to glance over an employee's details, view or add them to Departments, view or add them to Employee groups, and give them  additional access . Press anywhere on the employee list to open the quick edit menu.   2. Full edit The full edit allows you to access and edit all data related to an employee's employment, such as personal and work details, documents, shift and leave overview and much more. You can access full edit by hovering over an employee's name and clicking the  ✎  icon to the right or by opening quick edit   and clicking  Edit .     Edit employee details from the schedule To edit details of an employee from the Schedule, you need to ensure you are in the Employee view, as this cannot be done from either the Groups or Positions view. Hover over the employee's name and click the ✎ icon to open the  Quick edit  menu.     Invite multiple employees to Planday If you want to invite multiple employees in bulk, navigate to  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Send Invitations  and select the Departments you wish to invite. The employees will receive their invites once you press  Send as email , and you will see an overview of which employees the invitation has been sent to.   Because invitations are sent to the employees by e-mail, they must be registered with a valid e-mail address as their username.   Invite employees individually to Planday If you wish to send an invite to an individual employee, navigate to  People  and hover over the employee's name. You can click the middle icon in the list view to invite the employee.   Alternatively, you can open the Quick edit menu and click the invite employee icon.     Send notifications when new employees are created In  Settings  >  Portal settings  >  Notifications  you will find the  New employee created  option.  Add  Employees to this list if you would like them to receive notifications when a new employee has been created in Planday.

What is the Positions view? The  Positions  view allows you to manage your  schedule  when filling in for suitable roles is more important. The positions view provides extra information to your employees on specific tasks or roles they will fulfil each shift. This article will walk you through creating, editing, and working with Positions and Sections on the Schedule. How to switch to the Positions view To begin, note that there are three view options for your schedule:  Employees ,  Groups , and  Positions .   The  Positions  view lets you separate an Employee group into Sections and Positions, providing you and your employees with role-specific information on the Schedule. 💡 A  Section  is a label used to organise a selection of your positions. When you create a new Position, you can assign it to a Section by dragging and dropping it into the relevant Section. For an overview of how  Departments ,  Employee groups , and Positions work together, read more about  desktop Scheduling .    How the Positions view works For instance, if you run a chain of clinics, you might have one or more Departments for each location, with employees assigned to Employee groups based on their roles. (e.g. Receptionists, Nurses, Doctors). Positions view lets you: Label shifts based on the responsibilities required by the shift. Efficiently allocate your Employee groups across the different areas of your business where you need them. Ensure all areas of your business are adequately staffed.  Each Position's name is shown on the Schedule for managers and employees. Each Position is assigned to one Employee group. You can create multiple Positions per Employee group. In the image below, you can see the section  Daylight Ops  with two positions,  Reception  and  Clinic Room A . One position is assigned to the Employee group  Receptionists  and the other to  Nurses.  Each Section also displays the total expected hours and costs for the positions in the Section, alongside a total shift count.   Add new or reorder existing Positions and Sections To add or manage your Sections and Positions, select the  Positions  view and then click on  Manage Positions and Sections ; a window will pop up on the right-hand side of your screen.

Before using this feature, please  register your IP address for Punch Clock web access . Managing the  Punch Clock  can become complex as the number of employees, departments, locations or devices increases. Several employees may want to punch in and out at the same time, you may want to make more devices available at different locations, or you may want to ensure that employees do not see the names and shift times of other colleagues.   Punch Clock kiosk profiles  allow you to customise Punch Clock for the web for different devices used across multiple locations where several employees punch in and out.   For example, you can create  Punch Clock kiosk profiles  for individual devices that allow department-specific employees to punch in to make the login experience quick and efficient. A profile always consists of a name, assigned departments and a method for identifying employees. This lets you filter and customise the Punch Clock experience for only the employees that need to log in from that device.   You can set up the Punch Clock so that it can only be used in specific locations or on certain networks. You can learn more about this in the article  Set up your Punch Clock . 💡 Note that the use of the Planday app remains unaffected by kiosk profiles. To enable the use of Punch Clock via the app, go to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Employee access  >  Mobile App Access  >  Punch Clock used in mobile app  >  Yes . The kiosk profiles are only valid on the devices to which they are assigned and used on the web login function via PunchClock.Planday.com. Create a Punch Clock kiosk profile Navigate to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  section >  Profiles . From there, click  Create Profile  button.   Name  - Choose a descriptive name for the profile that suits you best. Planday recommends an intuitive name related to the department or location for time tracking. For example, if you want to create two separate kiosk profiles for two restaurants at different locations, the following would be conceivable: Restaurant1 time recording / Restaurant2 time recording. Departments  - You can assign one or more departments to the profile. This can be useful if you want to group and filter the employees using this profile. A department can also be added to multiple profiles if necessary. Employees from departments you do not assign to the kiosk profile will be unable to use it to clock in and out. Employee identification method  - You can specify the method employees must use to identify themselves on this profile when recording time. Here you can choose between  Username  and  Employee overview. The  Username  option requires employees to enter their username and password before being allowed to punch in. The employee view at  PunchClock.Planday.com  is shown in the screenshot below. The  Employee overview  option displays a list of employees who have a scheduled shift for the day. Employees can select themselves from this list and punch in. Unlike the first option, the username will already be taken from this overview. The employee view at  PunchClock.Planday.com  is shown in the screenshot below. 💡 Note that with this option, all employees who have access to the Punch Clock device may see the name and shift times of other employees using this kiosk profile. After setting up the Punch Clock preference, press  Save  to confirm. Assign a Punch Clock kiosk profile to your device Created kiosk profiles can now be assigned to specific devices. Provide your employees with a stationary device such as a computer, tablet or laptop, and give this device to the appropriate profile. Navigate to  PunchClock.Planday.com  on the desired device and log in. Please follow the steps regarding web setup in the  Set up your Punch Clock  article if you haven't set up a Punch Clock yet. 💡 If you want to enable punching in and out with a stationary iPad, the Planday Kiosk app may be an alternate solution. Learn more in the article  Planday Kiosk app for iPad . Follow the steps below to assign a kiosk profile to the kiosk app. At the top right of the  PunchClock.Planday.com  home screen, click the Settings icon ⚙️. Only users with admin privileges can change the settings. If you need a different configuration, please contact our support team.   The  Punch Clock kiosk profiles  you created in Planday settings will appear in the Profiles area (see graphic, area 1.). Press  Assign  to set the kiosk profile to the device you are currently on. Give your device a descriptive name in the area on the right (2.) such as a  Kitchen tablet .   The setup is complete with the assignment of the kiosk profiles to the desired devices. You can always readjust the settings as needed. ⚠️ If a kiosk profile assigned to a device does not include some departments, employees from those departments will not see their shifts on this device. To ensure the functionality of the Punch Clock and to avoid errors, make sure of the following: The device used for punching in and clocking out should be set to the correct time. This applies to shared devices such as tablets, computers or laptops and employees' devices. Your web browser should be up to date if you plan on using it as a Punch Clock solution.

If you want to enforce limitations or contractual obligations in your schedule, you should consider the  Contract rules feature  instead. What is a Working time rule? Working time rules  are used to set up guidelines for how to schedule your employees. You can for instance create a rule that says employees are not supposed to work more than 9 hours in a row. If you create a shift longer than 9 hours, a warning will pop up in the schedule, notifying you that you’ve broken the rule at which point you’ll be able to make the appropriate changes.    This way, you can monitor if your schedule fits within the guidelines you have set up. A working time rule  cannot  block you from creating or assigning a shift, even if it breaks its guidelines. How to set up a Working time rule? To set up a working time rule, you'll first need to create one starting from a structure that fits your needs best.   Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Working time rules  >  Create Working time rule .   This will open a new window for you to choose which type of rule you want to start setting up.

Act on employee comments from the Punch Clock. Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 This article is for beginner admins.  Here's a quick guide on  setting up Punch Clock  if you haven’t configured it already. The  Punch Clock  feature helps you stay in control of work attendance. You can use it to compare scheduled shifts to worked shifts and map out what to improve in your schedule.     With Punch Clock enabled, you can approve timesheets for payroll directly in Planday. Punch Clock is available on the web platform, the stand-alone  Kiosk app , and the  Planday app . How to approve Punch Clock entries in Planday You can approve Punch Clock entries using the  Pending actions  widget on the front page or by going to  Schedule  >  Punch Clock .   The Punch Clock page allows you to review and approve entries (shifts) per week or day, see approved shifts, and get a daily or weekly overview of approved vs unapproved stats. On the  Approve per week  (or  per day ) page, you will find all the clocked entries or shifts needing approval by a  Schedule manager or Admin .   Shift time  - This is the originally scheduled shift time. Punch time  - This is the actual punch-in and punch-out time. Start  &  End : These are times to be approved for payroll. This will differ from the punch-in/out times if you use  rounding rules . If there is no punch-out time, in case an employee forgets to punch out, this will be indicated by a red flag. You can manually enter a time in the End box and approve the Punch Clock entry. Adding an  End  time for a Punch Clock entry will also end the shift the employee forgot to punch out of. This is particularly useful if the Punch Clock is set up to use geofencing and the employee is no longer at the right location (which prevents them from using Punch Clock).   ⚠️ If there is no punch in or out time, there will be no punch clock entry. In this case it is not possible to manually create an entry, but instead, you should adjust and  approve the shift from the  Schedule .    Lastly, If these fields cannot be edited, it is because  deviation rules  are in place and you must decide if you want to use them to account for overtime or undertime.   Length  - This indicates the total length of the shift.   A single shift cannot be longer than 24 hours; if this happens, you must split the   shift before approving. Break  - This box is selected by default if you use automatic  breaks .   You should untick this box if an employee did not take a break. Comment  - You can see any remarks about the shift from the employee, upon punching in or out. Encourage your employees to leave a comment if they deviate from the scheduled shift. Selection box  - With the selection boxes you can pick which entries should be approved. Press the box on the top to bulk-select all entries for approval.  Alternatively, you can select individual entries for approval by checking the box in front of individual punch times. Once you have made the necessary corrections, press  Approve selected  to finalise the selected entries. Similarly, when an entry needs to be removed, select it from the list and press  Delete selected . Once these shifts are approved, they are ready for payroll. Approved shifts and Punch Clock entries can be found under the  Approved  tab,  Overview per day  or  Overview per week . 💡 Please note that if you use an ePOS integration, such as  Tevalis , the Punch Clock data will only appear in Planday once the user has clocked both in and out for their shift. How to approve Punch Clock entries using the Planday app As a  Schedule Manager or Admin , you can adminster the clocked shifts from the  Planday app . Besides being able to punch in or out yourself from a scheduled shift, you can supervise and approve your employees' Punch Clock entries. ⚠️  Please note that approving of Punch Clock entries on the Planday app is available for all Planday organisations except those using  Deviation rules . As you open the Planday app, whenever a new entry needs your attention, it will immediately appear in your  Requests  widget, under  Punch Clock entries  and also under  More  >  Requests > Punch Clock entries .   Tap on the  Punch Clock entries  to view the entries pending your approval. You will have a quick rundown of each entry and the option to  Approve  on the spot. You'll get a confirmation and the entry will disappear from the list.   The list will contain Punch Clock entries for  completed  and  ongoing Shifts , so you can add an end time and approve an employee's shift if they didn't punch out themselves. 💡  Unlike on the web, the mobile app does not support adding payroll supplements manually or splitting shifts longer than 24 hours for Punch Clock entries. For either of those, please use the web component of Punch Clock. Also, please note that the list of pending entries will only show entries from the last seven days. Log in to Planday on the web to see all the previous entries.   Need more help?   Please search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our ▶️  video tutorials .

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents Punch Clock deviation rules can help you automate some administrative tasks for shifts that differ from their scheduled punch times. Once you have configured the rules, Planday keeps track of your employee's hours and the changes between their actual and scheduled hours. The deviations will show as suggestions along the rest of the shift in the  Punch Clock approval  to be approved by an admin or schedule manager.   With deviation rules, you can configure Planday to automatically: differentiate the hours worked before or after the scheduled hours. track and calculate the average of the deviations in working hours, for each employee, over time. calculate the effect on salary at the end of a salary period for each employee. ⚠️  Note that using  Rounding rules  in your Punch Clock may conflict with applying deviation rules. You may need to turn them off or configure Rounding rules to start only with carefully calculated durations. How to create a deviation rule To begin with, create a deviation rule by going to   Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Deviations from scheduled time  >  Create Configure a deviation type After pressing  Create , you can choose which scenarios you want to track and what to happen when the selected scenario occurs. You can make changes later if the initial setup does not suit your scheduling needs.   Name  - This will be used as the name in the deviation rules list.   Deviation type  -   The different deviation types describe different scenarios where you can define what should happen when the scenario occurs. Below you can read more about what the different types are used for. Arrives early  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between punching in before and the scheduled start time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching in happens at 9:30 am, rules of this type will affect the time from 9:30 am to 10 am. Arrives late  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between the scheduled start time and punching in later than the planned time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching in happens at 10:30 am, rules of this type will affect the time from 10 am to 10:30 am. Leaves early  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between punching out and the scheduled end time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching out happens at 5:30 pm, rules of this type will affect the time from 5:30 pm to 6 pm. Leaves late  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between the scheduled end time and punching out. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching out happens at 6:30 pm, rules of this type will affect the time from 6 pm to 6:30 pm. Shift length not reached  determines what should happen when an employee hasn’t been at work long enough on a given day. The timesheet must have a start and end time to calculate the shift length for this type. This type matches if the punch time length is less than the actual shift length.  This type is not affected by the placement of the shift and the Punch Clock entry. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4 pm, the employee has been working for the correct 8 hours and rules of this type will not generate any deviations. On the other hand, if the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 3:30 pm, 30 minutes of work is missing and rules of this type will generate a deviation from 3:30 pm to 4 pm. Shift length exceeded  is used to determine what should happen when an employee has been at work for too long on a given day. For this type, the shift must have a start and end time to calculate the shift length. This type matches if the punch time length is greater than the actual shift length.  This type is not affected by the placement of the shift and the punch time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4 pm, the employee has been working for the correct 8 hours and rules of this type will not generate any deviations. On the other hand, if the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4:30 pm, the employee has been working 30 minutes extra and rules of this type will generate a deviation from 4 pm to 4:30 pm. 💡  Note that rules concerning  shift length  always have the  highest priority  compared to other types. When a rule related to the shift length has been matched with a shift, all other rules will be ignored for this shift. Final shift type  - Defines the  Shift type  that will be applied to the new shift made by the deviation. For example, if an employee stamps out too late, it can generate overtime according to a deviation rule. See the example below for this use case. Minimum length  - Defines the minimum number of minutes the deviation must be before this rule processes it. 0 means that the rule affects all deviations. Start of shift  - Defines from where in a deviation this rule should start, as time in minutes. 0 means that the rule should apply to the whole deviation. Length  - Defines how long a deviation of this rule should be treated as time in minutes. 60 would mean 1hr.  Depending on your requirements, you can limit your Deviation rules to only apply under certain conditions. You can set them using the following settings. By default, the rule applies to  All  shifts and employees. Shift types  - Apply the rule only to specific  Shift types .  Departments  - Apply the deviation rule only to certain  Departments . Employee groups  - Limit the deviation to only certain groups of employees by selecting an  Employee group . Employee types  - Apply the rule only to some  Employee types . Remember to press  Save  and continue the same process for all desired Deviation rules you create. Example of a shift length exceeded deviation rule  To show how deviation rules work in practice, here is an example with the type  Shift length exceeded .   First, the rule is created by going to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Deviations from scheduled time  >  Create .    This deviation type is used when you want to specify what should happen when an employee has been at work for too long. You want to count his hours towards an overtime account by applying a Shift type, a final shift type is chosen here that provides overtime, ie. “+”, On the Time Off Account.    In this example, the  Shift type   Flex + (100% ) is applied and it is set to generate overtime as defined under  Settings  >  Absence  >  General .   The  Minimum length  is set to 15. This is the minimum number of minutes the shift must be exceeded before the rule takes effect.   The  length  is set to 120 minutes which indicates that the rule is valid for up to 2 hours.   Example shift with deviation rule applied in Punch Clock & Schedule In the following example, the employee has a shift from 16:00-21:00. He stamps in 30 minutes before the start of the shift and stamps out 35 minutes after the end time of the shift. This gives a total of 1 hour and 5 minutes affected by the above deviation rule. Under  Schedule  >  Punch Clock,  you can see how the shift is divided up if the deviation rule is used. The first 5 hours have the shift type Normal and the remaining time of 1.05 hours has automatically been given the shift type Overtime (Flex +). According to the setup, this type of shift will generate additional time for the timeoff account if an administrator approves the deviation. In the Punch Clock overview, the shift before approval will look like this where 5 hours are considered as normal scheduled hours and the extra 1.05 hours are split and counted as overtime. On the  Punch Clock approval  page, you can choose whether you want to use the deviation rule by selecting between Yes or No before approving the hours for pay. When the shift is approved, you can see the division in the shift schedule as shown below: Need more help?   Please search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our ▶️  video tutorials .

Your employee will be advised to self-isolate and contact you and their healthcare provider for the next steps.   Here is an example of how the pop-up looks in the mobile app.   The Health check is only available through Punch Clock. If you're not currently using Punch Clock, you can contact our support team for assistance (from the messaging icon in the bottom right corner) or follow this quick  guide  to set it up.    When enabled, the Health check will appear across all platforms you might use within your organization for Punch Clock - be it web, the mobile app, or the Kiosk app.  The health check will be shown every time one of your employees start a new shift.    Enable the Health Check You'll have to navigate to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Survey  to set it up. If you want to use the Health check and cannot find the entry in the side menu, please reach out to our support team to have it enabled.    The Survey for Punch Clock is by default disabled, giving you the option to decide whether it's something relevant for your organization.  Please note that the current format is preset and mainly relevant for the current COVID-19 context.    To enable the Survey, simply toggle on the two options.  The first will enable the pop-up to show before an employee starts a shift and the second will ensure that a notification is sent - when needed, as soon as an employee answers.    The notification will be sent as a message through Planday (and an email if that is how you've configured your communication settings).  You can read more about  messaging through Planday app .   The message will contain information about the  employee  that attempted to punch in and which  shift  they wanted to start.    This message will be received by the employee's direct  Supervisor  (as set up on your Planday), managers for the Kiosk app, and any user with an  HR manager  permission.  If you are using custom security groups and permissions on your Planday, you should be aware that the notification might be sent to all the users that have access to edit an employee's details.   You can read more about  Access levels here .   Stay safe!  Need more help?   Please search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our ▶️  video tutorials .

The  View  button from the right upper corner, soon to be  View settings , will no longer open a small dropdown menu for you to toggle a few items. Instead, it will bring a full list of categorized options for you to choose what you want to have shown in your Schedule.   This could include information about Shifts, scheduling details from your employees, financial information, and your Planning metrics. Please note that what information you may have access to depends on your  permission level  and/or the  subscription plan  active for your organization.   Added additional settings and customization options for  Auto-schedule If you are on a Pro plan (or above), you're probably already using the  Auto-schedule  feature to get a draft of your complex Schedule within minutes. You'll be happy to hear that a few more options are now available for you, including: adjusting the result quality vs.  processing time ; how to account for your employees'  Availability  preferences; choosing between a rotating or fixed scheduling approach and whether to take into account breaks or working hour requirements You can find more details about Auto-schedule in our  setup guide  and more details about the advanced settings in this  article .

Vacations accounts  and  Overtime accounts  are listed separately under  Absence accounts   From  Schedule  >  Absence Accounts , you can now get an overview of all the Overtime accounts set up for your organization, from the standalone  Overtime accounts  tab.   This means that Overtime accounts will no longer be shown in the same list as Vacation accounts. Please note that, at this time, the  Export  function will still show a joint list of Absence accounts, according to your selected filters and dates.   Through the overview tab for Overtime accounts, you can sort the list by: Account name Start date (Valid from) End date (Valid until) Employee type Start balance, and Available balance (balance to date) Or you can filter it using the filter for Account name, Employee type or groups, and Departments. Coming soon:   Overtime  will be renamed to  Time off in lieu In order to align across markets and to describe more accurately what the  Overtime  feature supports, it will be renamed to  TIme off in lieu .   This applies to all the related aspects to Overtime, meaning that: Overtime accounts  will become  Time off in lieu accounts Overtime requests  will become  Time off in lieu requests , and so on. This change does not bring any changes to functionality and the management of  TOIL  (Time off in lieu) accounts will remain as part of Absence ( as a type of Absence accounts).   Improved absence request  notifications You can now decide whether or not you want to send a notification to your employees after handling their absence requests.   Whether you approve or deny a request, you can toggle on or off the option to  Send a notification to that employee . By default, this option is enabled.   This can be particularly useful if you don't want to distract someone at work or send too many notifications to an employee's inbox. As a reminder, you can find and handle Absence requests from  Schedule  >  Absence requests .   Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 6.15.0 ) or iOS ( 6.15.2 ).

The functionality is still the same as you are used to, but some things are moved around to make it more intuitive for you to use and provide a fresh look and better overview.   You can explore the changes by going to  People  >  Employees  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Edit salary .     Added support for  Salary periods Besides a monthly salary, we now support more salary periods. This will allow you to define the fixed salary amount the employee is entitled to get paid over a year, month, fortnight or week.   The Salary period is selected per employee and can be found under  People  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Edit salary .

The Pay periods that are supported are weekly, fortnightly, and monthly. This applies to both an hourly wage and a fixed salary.

The breaks you currently have are still set to unpaid unless you manually change the type.

For this new feature, you will need to have  contract rules  setup for your employees. Here's a quick  guide  to get you started. With everything in place, you will have an overview of what's on your employees' schedules, how many hours they are from fulfilling their contract requirements or how many hours they worked above that.   If you have employees that have exceeded the contract rule within a certain period, you have the option to record that as balance in an Overtime Account (Settings > Absence, Overtime, Vacation > Overtime account). Finally, you will find an overview under  Schedule  >  Contracted hours  and a daily working hours breakdown for each employee, by tapping on their avatar, in the  Schedule  view.   Coming soon:  Updated Employees list with a new column for days since Last shift From  People  >  Employees  you can now see how many days it's been since an employee worked a scheduled shift. You can add this column in the employee list as a guide for making scheduling decisions or to guide HR decisions. To view  Last shift , go to  People  >  Employees  and tap on the upper right  Employee details  button. This will open a list with all the available information fields that you can view in the list. From here, choose  Last shift  and then click Save. Like every other column in the Employee list, you can sort  Last shift  ascending or descending by the number of days listed, to identify easily which employees has been away or not recently been at work. Added a new feature:   Contracted availability Whether you have a contractual agreement with your employees that specifies scheduling guidelines or just a mutual understanding that influences the schedule, it will now be easier for you to prioritize them based on that. With Contracted availability, you can set the  weekdays  and  time intervals  when the agreement specifies that an employee should be available for work, for every employee. You can add or edit an employee's Contracted availability from  People  >  Employees . Clicking on that employee's entry in the list will open a quick edit side window from where you can "" Add "" the time intervals and weekdays, as shown in the picture below. Once the availability is all set up, every time you create or edit a  Shift  in the  Schedule , the employees contracted to work during that timeframe, will be highlighted. When hovering on top of the  green icon , you will see the time interval from that employee's  Contracted availability  that fits with the shift in question.

Also, it includes:  Updated  Account  >  Vacation  to  Account  >  Time off As a result of the newly added support for accrued vacation, hour-based vacation, and overtime accounts for some countries, aspects of the  Vacation  feature have been updated in the mobile app. An important change is that your vacation information can now be found under "" 🏝 Time off "", in your  Account . Please note, that this  replaces  the menu entry labeled ""Vacation"" from previous versions of the app. Other updates: Employee Sections  in  Schedule  >  Employee View  are fully now supported for both iOS and Android One day vacation entries are now correctly displayed as single days and not date ranges, in  Account  >  Time   off .

To make things simple, you, and your managers, can only see the departments you have access to. In the same way, the Shift requests are now displayed in chronological order (based on when the request was made), going back 7 days and highlighting if there is a shift conflict for each request. From this view you can assign your employees directly. Any other changes to the shift, can be made from the Schedule view. Once you manage the request, the employee will be notified automatically, by default. Additionally, you can send them a text message, if that is setup and available for your portal. Check out the new pages in Schedule > Pending requests.   Added Shift Overview page Information is key in fast paced business, and we always work to make data readily available and tailor made for you.

The Shift Overview page can be set to display the period you need from the Date range, and you can switch between employees from the Employee dropdown menu, once the view is open. You should keep in mind that this overview takes into account the department restrictions set for you or your managers. The new feature is accessible from a the Shift Overview icon, for each of your employees, in the Schedule > Employees view.   Fixes & Minor Updates Fixed an issue that prevented displaying whether a shift had effects on an employee's Overtime Account, from the Schedule view. Restricted notifications and emails from being sent to deactivated employees. Fixed an issue that sometimes triggered an error message when editing or adding a position, in Schedule view. Payroll costs are now displayed correctly in Schedule view, for Positions, reflecting whether they ""Affect Revenue"" or not. Ensured that Payroll exports can include Monthly Salaries, for both ""All Shifts"" and ""Approved Shifts"", if needed. Removing breaks when editing a shift no longer blocks saving those changes on the Shift Restored Edit employee from Schedule > Employees view. Fixed an issue that prevented Overtime hours to be registered from respective Shifts, if created from a Schedule template.

This is in line with the Pending Requests page update (Schedule > Pending Requests), improving loading time and display accuracy.

Here's what's new: Web: Prevent employees from modifying their names via their employee profile The  First name  and  Last name  fields can now be set as read-only on the employee profile. Previously it was not possible to apply changes to the setup of these two fields. This enhancement will help prevent employees from editing their own name, adding non-standard elements such as emojis, or a name that doesn't match the one entered on an integrated payroll system.   As an admin, you can now go to  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form set-up  > edit the  First Name  and  Surname  field, uncheck the  Required field  and  Allow editing  option under  Personal settings.   See  How to modify the employee form   Improved Absence account management: Individual Salary codes are now visible and editable in the account pop-up Managing Salary codes for individual Leave accounts (or Absence accounts) has become more convenient with the latest update. In the past, the Salary code of each Leave account was not visible. This may have caused confusion when changes were applied to the Salary code assigned to a Leave account template, as the code is not automatically updated for existing employees' accounts that were created applying said template.   However, you can now easily view and edit the Salary code for individual Leave accounts, ensuring consistency across templates. This improvement streamlines the task of ensuring uniformity in Salary codes, providing a smoother experience in managing leave.   See  How to apply leave accounts to your employees   App: New version of Planday app 9.0 is available! Welcome to the new and improved version of the Planday app 9.0! This release brings an updated  People  feature, under the  More  tab, as mentioned in the previous update. This allows you to access and update your colleagues' profiles faster and more efficiently.   This update removes support for managing Departments and Employee groups from the app. You'll need to access Planday on web if you need to update the structure of your organisation. Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 9.0.x ) or iOS ( 9.0.x ), updating to newer versions as they are released. Download Planday app for mobile devices   Integrations: Easily connect Planday with even more online services You can now find 3rd party integration partners right within Planday.

This means you can seamlessly combine the power of Planday with other apps to simplify your workflow and boost productivity.

The latest enhancement enables the seamless synchronisation of data into Fortnox, including the  allocation of cost centres . With this update, you can enjoy a streamlined process while syncing shift data to Fortnox.    The update also brings improved sync status reporting and the introduction of a new error notification in case of any mismatched cost centre codes. This improvement enhances efficiency eliminating the need for complex export and import procedures of PaXML files for timesheet data in Fortnox.   See  How to sync data into Fortnox cost centres   Open API updates: Salary periods can now be managed via Pay API  Salary periods are now available in Planday worldwide so that you can specify your employees' salaries over various periods, such as annually or weekly.   Integrations can now obtain and set this data in our  Pay API  endpoints. Monthly periods remain the default option before this feature's introduction.    Skills in HR and Schedule API  Skills help admins match the right employees to the right shifts. Thanks to our new GET Skills endpoint and skillID parameters in our HR and Schedule endpoints, you can now leverage this feature in our integrations.

Let's dive right in:   System Calendar update for  Bank Holiday Calendar The Planday System Holiday Calendar has been updated with the upcoming Bank Holidays, spanning now until 2025.  To update the calendar on your portal, you'll need to add the new days to your own calendar, from  Settings  >  Portal settings > Bank Holiday calendar .  Here, you can either extend the calendar you currently use until the 31st of December 2025 or add a new calendar starting on the 1st of January 2021 and ending on 31st of December 2025).  Then simply import the Holiday calendar dates from the System calendar from the  Add  button on the right side. Select the available calendar (2021-2025) to copy from and set the date from the 1st of January 2021, then click Add. As a reminder, the Bank Holidays can be shown in your Schedule ( from  Schedule  >  Views  >  Bank holidays/Vacations ) and can be useful when calculating vacation request costs.  You can read more about Holiday Calendars and set one up, in this  article . Added  Shift overview  in  Schedule You can now get a broad overview of your schedule, with the new  Shift status overview  page that will gather information about all your shifts. This can be useful, if you need to get a quick picture of how your Schedule looks like on a daily basis, for a particular department.  You can filter the view to display either one of the available shift statuses (open, assigned, for sale, and approved), for your selected Departments. You can also switch between scheduled weeks, on the same page.  Please note that the visibility of Shifts on the overview page requires the same permission levels as Shifts in Schedule or Department information ( learn more about permissions ).  The overview page can be found in  Schedule  >  Tools  >  Shift overview. Improved  Manual Payroll supplements  to be  Affected by   Breaks  correctly Until recently, Breaks were not considered in calculating Manual Payroll supplements, even if the ""Affected by Breaks"" setting was enabled. This means that Breaks were not correctly deducted from the supplement, which could have lead to incorrect costs for payroll. This issue has now been fixed, and the Manual Payroll supplement page will reflect the accurate behavior.  This means that the recent update will correctly show the  Affected by Breaks  setting disabled, for your Manual Payroll Supplements.  In order to enable it, simply edit your supplement settings from  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll Supplements  > and find the edit icon (✏️) for your Manual supplement, in its section.

You can now type in the rate you need, with up to 4 decimal points. Read more about how to set up Accrued vacation accounts and commonly used percentage rates, in this  article .  2. Added support for requesting vacation on behalf of an employee & requesting vacation from web In some cases, you might need to create a vacation request on behalf of an employee and with the new update, you can do so in 2 ways:  - either from  People  >  Employees  > select the employee >  Edit employee  (✏️) >  Vacation  >  + Add ; - or from  Schedule  >  Absence   requests  >  Request vacation  > select the employee.  and follow the necessary for requesting vacation.  More details about how to request  can be found in this article .  Once you've created the vacation request, remember to Approve it so your records are accurate.  You can find the vacation request later, under  Schedule  >  Absence requests,  if you need to.  At the same time, your employees can also request vacation from the web platform when they need to. In a similar way, they would apply for Time off through the app, your employees can do so from  Home  >  Your vacation  >  Request vacation .  3. Support for editing vacation requests Whether you need to modify an already approved or denied a vacation request from an employee or just need to change some details, you now have full control when managing vacation requests.  To edit requests, navigate to  Schedule  >  Absence requests  > find the request you need and tap on the edit icon on the right (✏️).  Please note that while you can edit past vacation requests, this is limited to a maximum of 1 month back, to avoid payroll inconsistencies.   4. updated Schedule > Absence requests page The list of Absence requests can grow large very fast and that can make it inconvenient to search through. We've added more filters to help you narrow down your search: by Date range by Request status by Department by Employee group by Employee type by Employees or by Absence account name 5. Monetary value and vacation balance now shown when editing an employee's  Absence  account A monetary estimate of the vacation balance an employee has left on their Absence account (or has accrued to date) can be found on an employee's assigned Vacation account, under  Schedule  >  Absence accounts.  This estimate is calculated based on your set configuration for Vacation Earnings, on the Absence account template.  You can see and edit this from  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  > Edit (✏️) for that Absence account.  The blue line on the Absence account highlights both the monetary estimate of the vacation balance and the vacation balance available to date, as additional information.  6.Reports for Vacation requests and Overtime requests Exporting requests report is once again available, in the formats you are already familiar with.  To pull a vacation request report or overtime request report, simply navigate to  Schedule  >  Absence   requests  >  Export  in the top right corner and pick the report you want.  7. Calendar view for Absence requests page You can get a better overview of the approved, denied and upcoming requests in a brand new calendar view ( from the dropdown menu in the top right corner, under  Schedule  >  Absence requests ).  The calendar view can be filtered like the List view, and requires a date range to be set, showing full weeks from the start to the end date you selected.

This month's release notes include:   For web: New look for your  login page , with an added  cookie policy  banner Improved performance for  lists , through  pages Accrued vacation  account management updates, including notification improvements and new filter options (DK only) Added support to restrict Managers from approving their own entries (details below) For the Planday app: embedded access to the Help Center with guides for using the Planday app Coming soon:  Messages  updates (details after the Web section)   Web New look for your  login page , with an added  cookie policy  banner The login page gets another fresh look this year to include a Cookies acceptance policy and to bring you a simpler, faster, and more accessible way to get your day started in Planday. The cookies acceptance policy is part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance and to be transparent about data usage.   The cookie policy banner includes a link where you can learn more about what cookies are needed and used for, also available here. Every 3 months, the same banner will appear on your login screen, so you can review the policy on a regular basis. Once you click OK, you'll be able to log in as usual.   Improved performance for  lists , through  pages Starting with the Employees list, we're adding an element of pagination to the way lists are handled in Planday. This means that lists will now load faster and will be divided into pages, of a max. 40 entries / page.   This is already in place for your list of employees, under  People  >  Employees , where you can browse through the list's pages from the top right corner of the list. The way you can filter the list is unchanged, with the exception of the fact that you can now see how many entries in your list fit with your selected filters. When no filters are selected, the number represents the total number of entries on the list ( that can be shown, considering the visibility settings in place for your organization )   This will soon be in place for the  People  >  Departments  list and  People  >  Employee groups  list, as well.   Updates for an improved management of  Accrued vacation  accounts (DK only) This month brings another series of updates to the Accrued vacation feature, part of the Vacation module, including:   1. Improved support for Notifications for vacation requests This update ensures that you will be notified as soon as one of your employees sends a vacation request and, in turn, that they will know right away whether their request has been approved or denied.   The notifications arrive in your message Inbox and can be read from both the Planday app and the web client. Depending on the response to your request, the message will contain a note from the approving manager and a balance update (when the request is approved)  Here's an example of the message from an approved vacation request notification:   2. Support for filtering vacation accounts based on availability In your Absence accounts overview list, from  Schedule  >  Absence accounts , you can now filter out the Absence accounts that do not have an active spending period. This means that through the  Active  filter, the list will only show you the Absence accounts that your employees can request vacation from (within the account balance requirements set for your organization).   3. Added ""Valid from"" & ""Valid until"" columns for the  Absence  accounts list   Under  Schedule  >  Absence accounts  you can find the list of Absence accounts assigned to your employees. This overview list will now also show you information about the validity period of a given account, including both the accruing period and the spending period (if they differ).   For instance, the  Valid from  column can help you sort the list based on accounts that are currently in use or accounts that will become active at a later point (but from which employees can still request vacation, to fit with their future plans).   4. Added a Do not use option for Vacation earnings When setting up template Absence accounts (or editing an existing one), you can now simply choose the  Do not use  option if no payout should be attached to an employee's vacation. This replaces the necessity to set a fixed rate of 0, for Vacation earnings to be ignored.   As a reminder, Vacation earnings are part of the account configuration from  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types  >  Accrued vacation .   5. Support for turning off automatic renewal for  Absence  accounts. You can now choose whether an Absence account should renew automatically or simply become inactive after the spending period is over. For example, this can be useful for account templates used for seasonal/temporary employees or used for transition periods that arise due to changes in regulation.   To configure this, you'll need to do so on the account template from  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types  where you can choose to edit an existing account or create a new one. The option to toggle off  Renew automatically  will be available in both cases.   Added support to restrict Manager permissions from approving their own entries By default, users with Admin and Schedule manager permission levels were able to approve Shifts and Punch clock entries, which included their own (whenever the case). With this update, this behavior will be restricted and no longer set as default. Please note, this update will not affect existing configurations made to accommodate this behavior.   This means that this will remain unchanged if the current setup for your organization allows your managers to approve their own entries.   When the restriction is in place, managers will no longer be able to approve their own entries as they will not be shown in the list of entries pending approval, both on the Planday app or through the web client.

Now, you can choose which Departments to include or exclude from your revenue reports.   Under  Reports  >  Revenue , you can select which departments to gather payroll costs and revenue data in one report, to assess the performance of a selected group of departments. As a reminder, the exporting data including payroll costs and revenue data requires Admin permission (more details about permissions in this  article ).     Support for Schedule Filters persisting throughout a login session and in-between sessions If you are using Filters when viewing your Schedule, you might notice that you no longer need to re-apply your filters every time you navigate back to your schedule.   To allow you to work smarter, not harder, we've added support for filters persisting throughout a login session and even in between sessions, if you log out. Filters will remain in place if you: Navigate to different areas of Planday and come back to Schedule Log in or out​ (with the same user) Switching back to a previously used network portal​ Close and reopen your browser or tab Please note, this does not apply if you switch between browsers or users while using Planday.   Absence: Accrued vacation additional updates (DK only) 1. Support for defining an accruing period for employee absence accounts   Depending on your needs for managing absence for your employees, you can now pre-define an accruing period for an employee's account.   This can mean either  setting a start date  &  end date  to the employee account, upon creating it or  using the pre-set default dates  (which will match the commonly used dates for the vacation period/year according to the local regulations). Setting a start date will allow you to automatically account for the hiring date for a new employee, while the end date will provide the option to consider the termination date for an employee or whether an employee needs to switch from one absence account to another.   Please note that when creating multiple employee accounts at once, the end date will be pre-set according to your template settings. You can change the end date after the account has been created, by click on Edit for that account.   2. As a precautionary measure,  unit conversion is no longer possible. This means that if you have created an Accrued vacation account (template) with an accruing rate in Days, you cannot switch to Hours while editing the account. This is meant to prevent accidental changes to your absence accounts or miscalculations.   3. Support for  hours/year  as Accruing rate   For Accrued vacation accounts, it is now possible to set a rate of accrual that accumulates hours per year and a maximum allowance of a set number of hours per year.   With an accrual rate like that, the number of hours corresponding to the rate will be added once per year.   As a reminder, you can set the  Accruing rate  and  Max. Allowance  for an Accrued vacation account when creating a new one, from  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types  >  Create .     Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 6.15.0 ) or iOS ( 6.15.1 ). The new version adds support for: Upload, send & remove attachments in Message This completes a series of updates for the Messages section of the app, which will soon be available for everyone. You can read more about Messaging through the Planday app in this  article , which also includes details about the recent updates. Ensured that all sections of the App respect the language preference set, including Time-off requests   Android  -  version 6.15.0 Ensured that  Create  and  Edit shift  both respect user permissions correctly. Fixed an issue preventing shifts from being created if breaking a working time rule.   iOS -  version 6.15.2 Fixed an issue that prevented the Comment field for a Time-off request to function correctly. Ensured app stability on login, removing some issues that caused an application crash on some devices. Please note that after updating to the newest version of the Planday app, you might need to log in again. Fixed an issue that caused Punch Clock entries to appear off by a day. Ensured that announcements and chat windows can be closed correctly, without leaving the app. Please keep in mind that, soon, you will no longer be able to update the Planday app on devices using iOS 12 (or lower). We recommend updating your iOS version to iOS 13 (or higher), if possible. You can read more about supported devices in this  article .   Kiosk app for iPad Make sure to use the latest version available for iPad Kiosk App ( 1.5.0 ) Added support for warning when there is no or a poor Internet connection The app will now notify you when there is no internet connection, This should help identify login errors faster and give you a clear indication of whether a poor or no internet connection is preventing you or your employees from punching in.

Here's a brief outline of what's been cooking in February 2020:     More options when selecting multiple shifts in Schedule When selecting multiple shifts, as a scheduling manager, you will be able to:    select entire rows/columns of shifts bulk add a comment to the selected shifts select multiple shifts from the 2-week view switch the selected shifts to Open shifts. This comes as an addition to the existing options, namely:   approving shifts in bulk editing shift type for selected shifts editing start and end time for selected shift times or deleting selected shifts Improved performance for Payroll report Sometimes printing or generating a payroll report can take more than a few seconds. But that shouldn't block you from continuing your work, so we've made some performance improvements to the way Planday collects the data needed for your report. This can now happen in the background, while you deal with other tasks. It will become the default behavior, but if you need it quicker, you can just reach out to our support team to have this feature enabled. As a reminder, you can generate  Payroll reports  in several formats (including PDF, MS Excel, CSV and more), from  Payroll.   Added Last online and Created date to the Employees list Whether your employees use Planday's web platform, mobile app or the Kiosk app, you can see when they were last online in the Employee list, by switching on the  Last online  column. This will display "" 12 hours ago""  for someone last seen online within the last 12 hours; "" 1 day ago "" - for someone last seen online between 12 and 24 hours ago, etc. Similarly, the  Created  column will show you the date when an employee was added to the Planday platform.   You can find this information in  People  >  Employees . If the columns are not already visible in the list, you can enable them if you click  Employee details,  select the field you want and click  Save .    Visual updates for Working time rules For Planday to do as much work for you as possible, things need to be easy to find and well explained. In an effort to achieve just that, the Working time rules page is getting a large visual update. The way the working time rules function for the  Schedule  has not changed, instead we made them easier set up and understand. You will start to see the result of this makeover in your portal in a few weeks time. In the same place as before, you can view, edit and create new Working time rules from  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Working time rules .       Upcoming changes to Employee form setup We're constantly making efforts to make your job easier, including maintaining employee records.  Very soon, you will notice a few changes to:     Gender field  - it is now possible to archive the field from an Employee form. This means that the field will be no longer required for an employee. Dropdown fields  - you will be able to create and adjust custom fields that offer multiple options, as a dropdown, without hassle or needing to contact our support team. You can see an example in the picture, to the right. Picture fields  - there is now a quick overview option, from the  Employees  overview. When you choose to display the Picture field, this will highlight whether there is a picture uploaded for each employee and give you quick access to the picture in question. Fixes and minor updates We removed the ""Refer & Earn"" from the profile menu  (top right corner on the web platform or under the Account tab on the mobile app), in preparation for upcoming changes. We encourage you to still be a Planday Ambassador and kindly ask you to contact our support team for next steps. Enabled ability to export Visma Lønn payroll without wages.  This can be configured from  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Manage the Visma integration , where you can toggle on/off including wages in the export. Mobile As announced last month, from Monday the 9th of March, you will notice     An updated  Login  page This step increases drastically the stability of the app and adds support for Single Sign-On with select identity providers. The authentication process has been redone to improve not only its stability and performance, but also to make it easier and friendlier for you to use. This includes keeping you logged in for a longer period and preventing being kicked out of the app. Single Sign-On is system that allows users to use a single set of login credentials in more than one place. This frees up time and reduces hassle on the long run, as your employees will be able to login faster and know more about how their information is used. This update also includes a visual-only update for login flow for web platform.    A big ""Thank you!"" to all of you who offered to try out and tested this feature before release. It was of huge help to make sure that switching to the new and improved login system is as smooth as possible, for everyone. Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android (6.2.1) or iOS (6.1.0).   Android - version 6.2.1 This version brings translation updates for  Punch Clock  messages and the  Employee  section (for creating or editing an employee entry). As we're constantly working on improving performance, we boosted the  People  section and fixed a few application issues, among which:        Schedule duration shown on the last week of year will now be displayed correctly The blue dot notification in  Availability , when you have a shift, was restored to its normal behavior. We ensured that the checkmark in Edit profile appears correctly The  chat  button should now be always available, even after the first time you login. We removed the redundant “Add Photo” function when creating/editing an employee We ensured that editing your profile, when you first login, is fully supported and smooth.     iOS - version 6.1.0 The update for this version focused on stabilizing the application, so that it works as you expect it. This includes:     A fix for an issue that was causing an application crash when selecting the displayed month in  Your shifts The blue dot notification in  Availability , when you have a shift, was restored to its normal behavior. We ensured that  Shift requests  display the complete and correct information, including who requested the shift and what time the request was made. The  Punch Clock  icon is now displayed in the correct color.  The efforts for the upcoming month will concentrate on performance and stability.  Did this answer your question? 😞 😐 😃"

Harvest season begins with some cool new features from Planday:   Added Bulk actions for employee management, including  Bulk edit wage  and  coming soon:   Bulk add to Department Business as unusual might bring with a lot of changes for your staff, and setting up Planday for several employees at once has never been easier. Navigation to and the functionality of bulk actions, for your employees, benefit this month from a series of minor, but important updates:  1. we've added support for  Bulk edit wage , which means that you can select all the employee profiles that need a wage update and get it done in a few steps.   2. and you can now also filter by  Employee type ,  Department , and  Employee group  when you need to (bulk) edit wages for your employees.   If you want to Bulk edit wages, you'll first need to select the employees that need the update, from  People   >   Employee Groups > Edit  (✏️ pencil icon from the right side). Using the filters available, select the employees from the list, by toggling the individual checkbox.  Once you're done selecting, find the  Edit wages  option, at the bottom of the screen (the pencil icon 3 ✏️).   A new window will open up, where you can set the  Wage ,  Wage type,  and define which date the change will be  Valid from . Save and you're done. You'll be able to see a change history for each of your employees and you can also edit individual wages later, if you need to.  3. you can now filter by  Employee type ,  Department , and  Employee group  when you need to (bulk) add people to an  Employee Group  or soon, to a  Department .  To  Bulk add employees  to an Employee group, go to  People   >   Employee Groups > Edit  (✏️ pencil icon from the right side), then find the  Add employees  button in the top right corner.  Similarly, soon you will be able to  Bulk add employees  to a Department, from  People   >   Departments   > Edit  (✏️ pencil icon from the right side) >  Add employees  button in the top right corner.   4. you can now hide the side menu panel in the  People > Employees  section. For example, this could be very useful if you have a very detailed view of your Employees list.  Simply collapse or expand the menu panel from the icon at the top.   5. in order to simplify things and to follow a consistent pattern, a few buttons were removed. The functionality still exists and can be accessed with no issues, as follows: a. we removed the "" Manage employees "" button from Schedule > Employees view > Manage employees. Instead, you can explore all the options to manage Employee profiles from  People  >  Employees . b. we removed the "" Manage groups "" button and the ✏️ Edit icon from Schedule > Groups view. Instead, you can tweak your Employee groups from  People  >  Employee   groups .   Added more options for removing  deactivated employee  profiles Shifting times also mean a lot of housekeeping work, even in the list of employee profiles on your Planday portal. If you've had to deactivate users recently, you'll be happy to hear that you don't have to wait a long time to have the records permanently deleted from the system (if that is what you need or want).  You can adjust the time-frame from  Settings  >  People  >  General  >  Delete deactivated Employees . Here you can set after how long the inactive users should automatically be deleted. This update expands the range from as low as 1 month to 10+ years.  If you don't find the option you need in the dropdown menu, please contact our support team for assistance.  Improved vacation management with more functionality, including  vacation requests filters  and  editing vacation requests (DK only) The big redesign project that the Accrued Vacation feature brought with it, includes more steps in the release of key features and functionality. For Danish customers, this month brings: 1.  filters  for  vacation requests  overview page   On the  Schedule > Absence requests > overview page  you will find 2 new filters that will help you sort through the vacation requests, by  Status  (All, Requested, Denied, or Approved) within a  Period  defined by Start date and End date.  To see all the vacation requests, simply select All for Status and leave the Period blank. 2. access for  Vacation requests  is now delimited by  Department permissions   To reduce clutter and make your vacation request handling faster, you will only be able to see and handle the vacation requests from your managed employees.  Like this, the  Schedule > Absence   requests > overview page  will show you only vacation requests that are relevant for you.  As a reminder, you can configure the individual employee Permissions from their quick-edit view, under  People  >  Employees  and you can get an overview of how permissions are configured on your portal, from  People  >  Employees  >  Security groups .  3. added support for  editing vacation requests   When a new vacation request comes in, it requires manager confirmation and handling. We've made it possible to edit a request's deduction before approval.  To edit a vacation request, you need to navigate to  Schedule > Absence requests  and find the request in question in the list and click the Edit button, on the right (✏️).  4. updated  Vacation reports   Under  Schedule  >  Absence accounts , you could always find an overview of your employees' Absence accounts. Now, besides a friendlier look, the account overview page gives you the option to  Export  a Absence accounts report.  You can filter through the existing Employee Absence accounts by  Period ,  Department ,  Employee group,  and  Account status,  just to name a few. Once you've settled on a filter configuration that shows what you need, you can export an Excel file that will contain more details for your filtered Absence Accounts, from the top right corner  Export  button.   The report will contain employee Absence accounts per row, and their details as columns, including:  Absence account type, the account balance, and the activity on the account.  Here's an example of how a report might look like:  Mobile Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 6.8.1 ) or iOS ( 6.8.0 ).

Please Note: This feature will be available soon for Germany, Canada, Belgium, Italy, Portugal and Switzerland. Please check back this page for updates. It is already available for all other supported countries.   Sections in Employee View This new feature allows schedule managers to add section bars in the employee view of the schedule to categorise their members of staff, independently of the sections already set up in the positions view. These sections will also apply to any templates. Creating sections allow you to organise your staff your own way, and quickly visualise the different areas of your business if you’re managing large teams. To do so, simply open the manage employees menu from the Employees view of the schedule, and click create section.   New Fields in Employee Details Menu We have added more fields to the Employee details menu in the People section. Now you can display the Country, Supervisor and Employee type fields for an enhanced overview of the Employees page.   Time frame setting for punch-ins This new feature gives Admins the ability to customise the time frame in which the Employees can punch in on a shift. This functionality is solving an issue with shifts starting just before or after midnight, for which employees have not been able to punch in before the change of day. Managers can now configure a customised number of minutes before or after the start of a shift for the employees to be able to punch in whatever the time or the day!   Break Edits Added to Shift History The History tab of shifts now allows you to visualise any edits made to the breaks for a specific shift, so nothing gets lost in translation.   Working Time Rules Update - Breaks Deduction This new addition to Working time rules deducts breaks from the total of hours, allowing you to have a more accurate view of how many hours your staff members are actually working. This applies both to the hours reports and warning pop-up messages when creating schedules.

The new payroll API supports payroll systems to build integrations to Planday with both user sync and payroll. Accessing the payroll API requires an admin with the right permissions to authorise the integration. To access the payroll API, head this way.

New Option for Templates A new option is available for you to choose when applying templates to your schedules. Additionally to the “Update existing, and add new shifts” and “Delete all and add new shifts” options, you can now choose to “Keep existing shifts and add new shifts”. This new option simply adds the shifts in the template to your schedule without making any changes to the existing shifts. This means nothing is lost, giving you more flexibility to fine-tune your template at a later stage. Please note that the new shifts might conflict with pre-existing shifts. If you’d like to know more about this new option for templates, check out our  help article .   Managed Employees Toggle This new toggle switch in the People section lets managers quick filter on the employees they manage, those whose details they can edit. When the toggle is enabled, the filters and counts for departments and employee groups update so you can quickly filter on your staff.   Avatars on Employees Page This change adds avatars to the Employees list in the People section. When an employee has a picture uploaded to their profile, this will be displayed to the left of their name in the Employees page. If no picture is uploaded, their avatar will show their initials.   Cost of Open Shifts in Schedule It is now possible to assign a cost to open shifts, that will then display in the schedule payroll costs. This functionality allows schedule managers to have a more representative view of their actual payroll costs.   New Condensed week/day/month Dropdown The old period selector has been condensed into a dropdown, and the date picker has moved to the left to allow for an even clearer view of your schedule and enhanced experience.   Always Require Position on Shift When activated, this new feature greys out the employee group in the Create/Edit shift view, which allows schedulers to create shifts only for specific positions, reducing errors when planning. Please note that this feature is not activated by default. To activate it, please contact our awesome  support team .   Added loading spinner when printing schedule We’re now displaying a spinner when loading the print, as a way of letting the user know that something is happening as it was previously confusing if the printer was slow to load.

Fixes & Improvements Web  We resolved an issue causing some deactivated managers to continue receiving email notifications. Fixed an issue causing error in schedule and employee edit due to duplicate hourly wage being saved to an employee. Manually entered values in date fields in certain formats resulted in errors and saving of incorrect date. We updated the Hogia payroll format, so that it matches the newest supported format. We resolved an issue with manual supplements not being deleted and removed maximum setting in supplements, so that the amount is always more accurate. We resolved an issue with the expected behaviour of templates: now when you select to delete all shifts before applying a template, it will only delete shifts in the chosen filters. We resolved an issue with the shift type setting “Overwrite when applying a template”, which did not work when deselected, so that now shift types that have this setting deselected will never be overwritten by a template. Mobile - General We have made significant reengineering work on the Punch Clock to make it more performant and enhance the stability and performance of the Apps. These changes are completely transparent for you and the functionality remains the same. Some improvements were also made to how the App updates changes made in punch clock settings. Punch clock settings will now update on pull to refresh from the Overview tab. The autogenerated content when replying to a message has been improved iOS Fixed the neutral state on Events. Fixed a crash when saving images from messages locally on your phone. Android Fixed a crash related to some punch clock setups. Fixed an issue resulting in some managers not being able to create new shifts. Fixed an issue causing an incorrect navigation bar to be shown in the Schedule for some users. Fixed an issue resulting in some shifts not showing up for the employee in Your Hours. Did this answer your question? 😞 😐 😃"

While you were enjoying some well-deserved relaxation time, we wrapped up new features for you to be well prepared to jump right back into working smarter, not harder.   Web Added the option to make  Custom text fields , from Employee details, visible in  Schedule Information is most valuable if provided to you where you need it. When scheduling your employees, details like license plates, t-shirt size, phone number, or email address might influence our decisions. Or maybe you'd just like more information to be readily available on the Schedule.  Custom fields  for the Employee form setup you can now be used to show the information you need in your Schedule, as text, through Text fields or Related fields.  Simply create a new  Text field  for the information you want to show in  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup . Then navigate to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  General  >  Names on the Schedule , find the Department you need, and then tap the edit ✏️from the right side of the new field you just created inside the display box. You will see all the text fields available in the Fields section to the left.      The  Custom text field  will be visible in the  Employees view , for the  Schedule  for the Department you chose to add it to.  You should keep in mind that creating and editing  Custom fields  is restricted through  access levels  (Security groups). and that you can always reach out to our  support team  for assistance if you need to.   Improved the management of  Employee Overview  list Sometimes speed is key when accessing information, which is why we've made 2 additions to the Employee Overview list:  → you can now  quickly search  for an employee using their  Tax ID . This expands the search options for your employee list to First or Last name, Email address, Salary identifier, and Tax ID.  → you can add show  true/false  (yes/no)  Custom fields  in your employee list, which can be particularly useful if you need to have a quick overview of which of your employees has a driver's license (or owns a car or has a particular certification), for instance.  If you need to add a new true/false field you can follow this quick  guide . Here's an example of how it could look like in the overview list, from  People  >  Employees .  Added a  View only  for  Employee Details When your HR managers need access to information from an employee's profile, they go to People > Employees > find the employee in question and tap the edit icon (✏️).  Previously, if a manager has the right access  permission  they could see and/or edit the information on an employee's profile. At times, this could lead to accidental changes and end up causing headaches for that employee, until fixed. The new  View-only permission  for HR managers will help minimize the risk of information getting lost or changed by accident.  This would also give you the opportunity to have a new Security group for HR managers that can view, but not manipulate employee data.  If this is a feature you would like to use, please contact our  support team  to have it enabled. Added support for  Greek  🇬🇷 Planday is now also available in Greek.  As a reminder, you change the language settings for your profile menu: → on the web client, you can  Edit  your profile settings from the top right corner menu. Then simply select your preferred language and click Save. → Similarly, on the mobile app, you can change your language settings from  Account  >  Settings & Privacy  >  Settings  >  Language .   From 12.08.2020:  Adding support for  Accrued Vacation  for Denmark-based customers. (DK only) With September fast approaching and the new Danish Holiday Act taking effect soon, the Accrued Vacation extension to how Vacation is managed in Planday will become available for danish customers.  As a reminder, the new Danish Holiday Act will mean that your employees will earn vacation days, based on how much they work (within and accrual period of 12 months) and can take vacation days based on what they've earned (within and spending period of 16 months).  You can create new vacation accounts to automatically add up the vacation days earned by your employees and easily manage their vacation requests.

Increased stability for  Messaging  in  Network   portals You can rely on Planday's Messaging in Network portals to reach the relevant employees and managers, as you would on a stand-alone portal.

Harvest season begins with some cool new features from Planday:   For web: Additional language support:  Japanese Locale Improved  data entry view  in the  Data Center  (for Pro & Enterprise) Improved support for  Absence accounts  (UK & DK only) Start balance  on Accrued account type Additional information in the  Absence account report Permission to  approve own absence   request   or not .

To change the language for your Profile on the web, hover over   the Profile menu point   in the top right corner >  Edit  >  Language  > choose your preferred language.     Improved  data entry view  in the  Data Center  (for Pro & Enterprise) The  Data entry table  under  Reports > Data Center > Data sets > Edit data  has been improved in order to more closely resemble the schedule itself. For managers navigating between the Data entry table and the Schedule, this will make it easier to see which  Positions/Sections  they are entering data for.​ ​ The dropdown list of  Positions  now also shows the name of the  Section , so it's easier for a manager to distinguish them, especially in the case where positions have the same name in different sections.   The  Data Center  feature is available for the  Pro  and  Enterprise  plans. Remember that you can always reach out to our  Support team  (chat icon, in the bottom right corner) if you have any questions or need assistance.     Improved support for  Absence accounts  (UK & DK only) Start balance  on Accrued account type When creating or editing an Accrued account type under  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types  you now have the option to set a  Start balance  for the account type. This value will be the start balance on all accounts both now and in the future.  The start balance can later be overwritten in your employee's individual accounts for each period. Additional information in the  Absence account report The Absence account report that you can export from  Schedule  >  Absence accounts  >  Export  is improved with some additional information: Department : one or multiple departments that your employee is associated with. Note:  a note from your employee's Absence accounts. Period start date and Period end date : dates are related to the chosen period. Leave pay : the value of leave pay at the end of the chosen period. Permission to  approve own absence   request   or not. We have added new permission that allows you to choose if your managers should be able to  approve their own absence requests or not .  The permission to approve own absence requests is connected to your  Security groups . It's by default turned on for all Security groups that currently have the permission to approve absence requests in general, so there are no changes made to the current permissions. With this new permission in place, you can now choose to   remove the right to  approve own absence requests  from specific  Security groups .  Example: You can choose to allow HR managers to approve their own absence requests, while Schedule admins cannot approve their own absence requests. When removing the permission to approve own absence requests from a Security group ( that already has the permission to approve absence requests ), the buttons to Approve or Deny are removed from their own request as shown in the picture below. Please reach out to our  Support team  (chat icon, in the bottom right corner) if you need to make changes to your Security group's Permissions. Updated  user interface We have updated the user interface for both  Absence accounts  and  Absence requests , to optimize the visual experience and structure the different sections on each page. Coming soon : Account Section We are soon ready to release the  Account section  where you will get an overview of your invoices and subscription plan details, as well as the option to download invoices from directly inside Planday.  It will be available under the Profile menu point in the top right corner, for all Account Admins.   Along with this, there is a new Security group called  Account Admin  in your portal. The Account Admin security group is, as of now, the default group for those responsible for signing up and setting up Planday for your organization. The Account section is only accessible to those in this new  Account Admin Security group .   This additional Security group will not affect your existing configuration, for Security groups and access permissions. Instead, the  Account Admin  group is meant for information purposes and does not grant access to any of the Planday features, on its own.   If you need to make changes to the permissions and security groups or you encounter something unexpected, please reach out to our  Support team  (chat icon, in the bottom right corner).     Mobile: Additional language support:  Japanese  Locale From  Account  >  Settings & Privacy  >  Settings  >  Language , you can now select  Japanese  as your preferred language in the Planday app. Available with the newest version of Android (7.2.0) and iOS (7.2.1).     API/Integrations:   Zapier integration The  Zapier integration  will allow you to use Zapier's available apps to integrate with Planday and be able to send  Revenue data ,  Create employees , or import  Business Analytics data  into Planday. This can help improve your scheduling solutions and be able to better infer how to improve your metrics. It can also help avoid duplicate data in both your HR system and Planday, as this would allow for employee data to only have to be created in the HR system and the integration can automatically create the same employee in Planday.   Head over to our  setup guide  for the Zapier integration to get started.     Coming soon:  Visma.net Payroll  integration (NO only) Soon you will be able to export payroll files for  Visma.net Payroll  from Planday.

Here's what's new:   For web Coming soon:  Data Center  (for Pro & Enterprise) Improved support for  Absence accounts  (DK only) Bank Holiday Calendar  can be set in  Absence account type Pagination  on  Absence account  page Cover shifts  when employee’s request absence   For the Planday app Removing  Report issue   Web Coming soon:  Data Center The  Data Center  is a new feature, meant to help you get one step closer to making data-driven decisions. Soon, you'll be able to find the  Data Center  under  Reports , along with  Planning metrics ,  Data sets,  and  Formulas .   One of the key parts of this new feature is the ability to get an overview of your business needs, directly in Schedule. With  Planning metrics , you will be able to gather in  Schedule , all the information you need to make better scheduling decisions. Get ready and learn more about the  Data center  and what it can do for you on our  help center .   The  Data center  feature will be available for the  Pro  and  Enterprise  plans. Remember that you can always reach out to our support team (chat icon, in the bottom right corner) if you have any questions or need assistance.   Improved support for  Absence accounts  (DK only) Added support for  Bank Holiday Calendar  in  Absence   account   types.  Under  Settings  >  Absence, Overtime, Vacation  >  Account types  >   edit  Account type,  you can make sure that the  Bank Holiday Calendar  is taken into account for the absence accounts set up for your employees. Connecting the  Bank Holiday Calendar  directly to an Absence account template will help you save time when managing Absence accounts for your employees and will keep track of their account balances more accurately. Improved loading time for  Absence accounts  overview list, through pages. Under  Schedule  >  Absence accounts , you can now browse through the account list one page at a time.  Each page contains up to 40 Absence accounts entries, and you can navigate through the list using the arrows in the upper right corner.  This improves loading time and the performance efforts started with the  Department  and  Employee groups  lists.    Added support to create  Cover shifts  when   approving an  Absence request Some of your employees' absence requests might overlap with scheduled Shifts in your   schedule.  If that happens, you will now have the option to create  Cover shifts ., directly from the request, under  Schedule  >  Absence requests ,  This adds one more option to the list of possibilities when approving an absence request:  - Delete the overlapping Shifts - Keep the Shifts, but change their Shift type - decide whether or not your Scheduled needs to be covered for those overlapping Shifts.  If you need the Shifts to be covered, you can do so by creating copies of the Shifts conflicting with the Absence request and automatically set them to Open.  The newly create Open shifts will be set to the same Employee group/Position as the original Shifts.  With Cover shifts, you will be able to fill your scheduling needs much faster and with more flexibility, even when your employees take time off.  The absence request shown in the image below is from May 10th to May 14th and overlaps with 4 assigned Shifts. When approving this request, choosing to create Cover shifts, will create Open shifts for the same group, within the same parameters as the original Shifts (also shown in an image below).

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For Admins, Schedule Managers and Employees using Planday.  Check the status of Planday here  status.planday.com  and subscribe to updates. Occasionally, Planday and its related services undergo  maintenance . This means that, during the maintenance period, those  services are unavailable . Depending on what the maintenance implies, you might not be able to access Punch Clock, use the web client of Planday, or log into to Planday app or Kiosk app.   The maintenance window is usually scheduled  outside of regular working hours.  However, if your organization has flexible or prolonged working hours, there might be scenarios in which your schedule will overlap with the planned downtime.  For example, some of your employees might punch out of the night shift while their colleagues start the early service.   Ideally, your schedule would be unaffected, but if your employees need to punch in or out using Punch Clock during this time, please follow the recommendations below to ensure that the correct start and end times are recorded.    We are very sorry about any inconvenience a scheduled maintenance window might cause. We need to perform regular maintenance operations to make system health checks and improve the stability and availability of Planday.   Thank you for your patience!   Recommended actions 1. Inform your employees about the upcoming maintenance You can send a  message through Planday , create a post in the  newsfeed , or communicate it using other preferred platforms.  💡 Please ensure that those with shifts during the maintenance window are informed about the downtime timeframe and what to do if their shifts start/end before or during downtime.   2. What to do when Punch Clock is unavailable If you have staff members who are scheduled to punch in or out during the maintenance window: Inform your staff that they won’t be able to use Punch Clock as they normally would during the timeframe. Put a system in place to register the affected shifts' start and end times. You can ask your staff to use the  comments  section when punching in later to add their punch-in/out times after the maintenance is complete.  Remember to register those times in Planday and  approve them as usual .  3. Approving Punch Clock entries after maintenance For employees who punched in before the maintenance window but did not have access Punch Clock during the maintenance: After the maintenance is complete, enter the shift end time under  Schedule  >  Punch Clock > To approve per week  (or  per day )   and approve the shifts, as usual.    In the overview list, the shifts without a start or end time will be marked with a red flag ( 3 ), next to the missing fields. If your employees choose to leave a comment on their shift, this will also be shown in the Comment ( 6 ) column.  This is similar to when an employee forgets to punch out at the end of their shift. Read more about  How to approve Punch Clock entries .     For employees with no Punch Clock entries on the day: Collect their start and end times. Go to  Schedule , find the shift, click on it and  edit both the start and end times  on the  Edit shift  view if needed.    You can approve the shift from the same view by using the  Approve  toggle on the right side or by selecting the Shift from the Schedule.

You can choose between the following options: Delete all (or some shifts) Set the employee’s future shifts (or some shifts) to open Leave all (or some) shifts assigned to the employee if they will work their remaining future assigned shifts in the Schedule Assign all (or some) of the shifts to another employee who works in the same employee group. 💡 To see the last option, the shifts must be attached to a  position in the Schedule . Finally, you can add a confidential note visible only to HR managers and Admins to document the reason for deactivating the employee (3).   Deactivating an admin who originally authorised an Integration or Open API app Some integrations, like Square or Lightspeed Retail X-Series and Open API apps, may stop working if they were authorised by an admin who another admin is deactivating. A pop-up will appear to indicate if any of the qualifying apps are affected. In such cases, the other admin must reauthorise the relevant integration.   To re-activate an integration, follow these steps: Go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview . Find the relevant integration in the list and activate it. For reauthorising Open API applications, refer to the article  How to use Open API to integrate with Planday  for detailed instructions.

Only managers with access to deactivate other employees (with access level Admin or HR Managers) will be notified of deactivations.   Inactive employee account deletion Following the right to be forgotten, under certain circumstances, and only on request and approval from a Planday admin, the Planday support team can act on requests to delete employee accounts permanently.   To delete an employee account, that account must have been inactive for 5+ years at a minimum. This is because data in the Planday is used for HR and payroll regulatory reporting by employers.   If an account is inactive for less than 5+ years, an employee must first contact their admin to see whether data can be removed. If there is agreement from the Planday admin that data can be deleted, then the employee account may be permanently deleted and cannot be retrieved at all. Data related to the account may also be rendered irretrievable.   We recommend that you only take this action when necessary and cautiously, as an employee will lose all payroll and HR history.   As an employee, to request an account deletion, please get in touch with your organisation's Planday admin first and then contact Planday Support team.   Automatically delete deactivated employee accounts Depending on where your business operates, you may have a legal obligation as an employer to permanently delete information on former employees after their employment has ended.    This is also relevant for staying compliant with your employees’ right to be forgotten, according to GDPR legislation.    To automatically delete deactivated users from your Planday account, go to  Settings > People > General > Delete deactivated Employees , to turn on the feature and set how many months after deactivation a user should be permanently deleted from your Planday account.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For advanced admins. Learn more about  creating or applying Contract rules here . Change in contract conditions An employee's working hours may change, such as going from full-time to part-time hours per week contract. You can adjust the contract rules accordingly to help you schedule their shifts.   Option 1  –  New Contract rule If you have time before the change date,  create a new contract rule  with a start date on the change date. Then, on the change date,  assign this new contract rule  to the employee in their profile.   Example:  On 15 September, an employee's weekly working hours change from 40 to 20 hours starting on 1 October. Create a new '20-hour week' contract rule with a start date of 1 October. Then, on 1 October, assign this new contract rule to the employee in their profile.  Option 2  –  Switch to an existing Contract rule You can assign one of your existing Contract rules to the employee. Note: In this case, the start date of this contract term is in the past. Important : Any change to Contract rules  also has a retroactive effect , depending on how far in the past the start date of the other contract rule is applied. If you accumulate  overtime based on contracted hours , this can lead to problems. Therefore,  before  you make the change, do the following: Transfer all hours accumulated in the past  Hours to transfer  to the employee's overtime account. You can find out how to do this in the article  How to use Contracted hours for schedule overview . If you cannot transfer all the hours, you can make minor adjustments manually (by editing the employee's profile > Time off in Lieu). Example : On 15 September, you find out that an employee's working hours will change from 40 to 20 hours per week starting on 1 October. You already have a ""20-hour week"" contract rule ready, but its start date is 1 January in the past. Before assigning the ""20-hour week"" contract to the employee in their profile, follow the steps described above. Changing the Contract rule start date of an interval 💡  It's best to set the start date to a Monday for weekly intervals or the 1st day of a month for monthly intervals. You might have situations when an interval start date aligns with a new employee's joining date. However, if this date falls in the middle of an interval, you may prefer the working hours to be calculated in a regular weekly interval - from Monday to Sunday. You can: either : Add a new weekly interval in the contract rule whose start date falls on a Monday. You can then select this as the primary interval. or : Change the start date of the Contract rule to a Monday. Important : Any change to Contract rules  also has a retroactive effect. This means that if you calculate your overtime based on your Contract rules, you will see some unwanted plus or minus hours when you change the start date of the interval.   In this case, you can manually adjust by editing the employee's profile under the Time off in lieu tab.   Example : An employee is assigned a ""40-hour week"" contract condition. They work five days a week (Mon-Fri), eight hours a day. The contract's weekly interval starts on a Wednesday, but you change it to the Monday before their first working day. This automatically transfers -8 hours for Monday and Tuesday, as they haven't worked on those days. To compensate, you can manually adjust overtime: Go to the employee's profile >  Time off in lieu  >  Create  >  Adjustment > select Monday as the date and enter 16 hours with a comment explaining the adjustment. Once saved, the hours will be balanced again.   Need more help?   Please search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our ▶️  video tutorials .

How to delete Employee groups You need to consider some essential points before deleting an  Employee group . Employee groups define your Schedules, so deleting an Employee group will impact existing schedules.   Review the following points to prevent any negative impact when deleting an Employee group: Previously created shifts connected to the deleted Employee group will remain visible and will still affect payroll. New shifts cannot be created using the deleted Employee group. Assigned shifts for the deleted Employee group can no longer be swapped. Open shifts for the deleted Employee group cannot be requested or claimed. Assigning employees to different Employee groups after you delete the Employee group can impact payroll if there are inconsistencies between the defined wages of the Employee groups or duplication of shifts. In most cases, we encourage you to reassign shifts and/or create new Employee groups before deleting the Employee group to ensure that your schedule remains dynamic. If you are satisfied that it is safe to delete the Employee group, you can follow these steps: Go to  People  >  Employee Groups . Find the Employee group you want to delete and press the  Edit  icon on the right. From the  Edit employee group  view, press  Delete  and confirm your decision.   Furthermore, if there are any Positions associated with the Employee group in your schedule, you will not be able to delete the Employee group. In this case, you will need to delete the Shifts for that position, delete the Position and then delete the Employee group.   How to restore Employee groups If you have deleted an Employee group but need to recover it, you can do so easily.  Navigate to  People  >  Employee groups  and find the  Restore Employee group  button in the top right corner. This will prompt a new window where you can select which Employee group you'd like to reinstate and whether or not employee memberships should be kept as they were before the deletion.

Use  Contracted availability   or  Working time rules  instead. What is availability? Availability allows you, the schedule manager, to record employees' wishes for work. Giving your employees shifts according to their wishes keeps them happy and can reduce the number of shift swaps and no-shows. Reduce managerial stress related to building a schedule and make a plan that will work for your business and your employees. This is how Availability works: Employees register their  availability from the Planday app  or  web . Employees' Availability is shown on the Schedule when looking to assign shifts:  green  for available,  red  for unavailable. Managers use the information to build schedules that accommodate the employees in the best way possible. As a manager, you can still schedule employees on unavailable marked days, but having availability data filled out provides practical knowledge by cutting down on back-and-forth communication. Using availability preferences when scheduling When you create a shift and employees have registered their Availability, you'll see their status when you're working on the schedule. As a manager, you decide to adjust the Schedule to your employees' Availability, and sometimes you might find yourself in situations where it isn't possible to accommodate their wishes. Available employees show with a green thumbs-up next to their names. Employees who have set themselves as Unavailable will be marked with a red thumbs down. If the employees have added a comment or reason with their wish, that will also show up when scheduling.   Customising options and intervals for Availability You can customise the availability function if it does not capture the necessary information for your needs.    Start by going to  Settings > Schedule > Swap & Availability > Availability.  Here you can set Availability by: Can/cannot work  (default) Intervals -  You can set up custom intervals employees can choose from, for example, Night shifts, Day shifts etc. Select start and end time -  This option will let your employees select a start and end time for when they're available or unavailable for each day. Set custom Availability settings In this example, the employer wants to capture further information from the employees, such as their availability to work night shifts. This can be configured by selecting  Intervals  under Available options from the Swap and Availability settings page. Employees will then be prompted to select from these options when they mark their availability:   How can employees register their Availability wishes Employees can mark their availability via the Planday app or by logging in from the web.  To set Availability via the Planday app , employees can navigate to  More  >  Availability  > press  Edit  > select the days you wish to mark > Mark your availability by pressing  Available  or  Unavailable  > press  Done . To set your Availability via Planday for desktop , navigate to  Home  >  Your   Availability  > press  Edit all  > select the days you wish to mark > Mark your availability by selecting  Can work  or  Cannot work.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For Schedule admins who need more detail in their scheduling or further breakdown of employees' roles. Read more about the  basics of scheduling . What are Skills? Employee groups  allow you to define the roles of your staff in Planday, while  Positions and Sections  will enable you to distinguish between subsets of these groups and where they should work in your schedule. With  Skills  you can define the skillset, expertise or special abilities needed for specific Shifts and limit those Shifts only to employees with those skills.   As an example, you can use Skills for certifications. If your work requires employees to have different courses or certifications, they can be assigned Skills to clarify their responsibilities. 💡 Note that on a Shift with a skill assigned, only employees with that competency can work on that shift.  How to set up Skills To create one or more Skills, go to  Settings  >  People  >  Skills  >  Create .   Assign/Add a  name  to the Skill.   You can choose to make the Skills  Time-limited . This can be useful if your employees obtain certifications that expire on a specific date. The dates are added individually for each Employee, and the same Skill can be re-assigned to another employee.   You can choose whether seniority can be specified when a skill is assigned to an employee by selecting the option  Show seniority .   Choose to which  Employee groups  the Skill relates to. You can create and choose a category for these skills if you use many. Write a description if necessary to help you remember the Skill and its criteria. Remember to press  Save . How to assign Skills to employees Assign Skills to your employees by clicking the plus icon (+). 💡 Clicking the number of employees under Employees in the image will show you the list of those already assigned the competency. You can also assign Skills to your employees directly by editing their profiles. Go to  Employees  > select employee >  Edit >  Employment  >  Skills > Add .   Use Skills on the Schedule 💡 To use Skills on the Schedule, you must create Positions. To learn more about Positions, see  Scheduling with Sections and Positions . Remember to turn on Skills under  Schedule  >  View settings  >  Skills  otherwise, they won't be visible on the Schedule. Once you have set up Positions, you can add the Skills to those Positions. You can do this by going to the Schedule under the Positions view. You then need to tap on  Manage Positions and Sections  and edit the Position to which the Skills will be linked.   When you create shifts in the Positions view with a Skill attached, only employees with the correct Employee group and Skills can be assigned to that Shift. You can also add and remove skills directly when editing a Shift.   💡 You can also filter your schedule view by Skills using  Schedule filters .   ⚠️ When applying Skills, it is essential to distinguish whether the Skill will be applied to the Employee, the Shift, or the Position.

The columns show the following values: Scheduled hours  - working hours from the shifts planned, excluding unpaid breaks. Approved hours  - past shifts, approved for payroll. Contracted hours  - the number of working hours required and specified by the contract rules within the primary interval. Deviation in hours  - A positive balance (🔴 red) indicates that the employee exceeded their required contracted hours. This can be transferred to their Overtime/Time off in lieu (TOIL) account. A negative balance (🟡 yellow) indicates that the employee has not met the required hours yet. This can be deducted from their TOIL account. 🟢 Green indicates balanced hours. Hours to transfer  - the number of hours eligible to be transferred to an employee's Overtime account balance. This considers previously transferred hours and recent changes triggered by Approved hours. Transferred hours  - the number of hours previously transferred within the selected period. Overtime account balance  - This is the current balance of an employee's extra hours or needed hours. The balance is displayed as an overall total, not restricted by the selected period. 💡 Please note that the number of working hours considered is also determined by the Shift types selected for the respective contract condition. Currently, the start date of a contract rule and the hired date of an employee are not linked to the calculation of working hours according to the contract. Transfer hours to overtime accounts Assuming you have set up  Overtime accounts for employees , and credit is available in the  Hours to transfer  column, you can transfer this to the overtime account. Both a positive and a negative balance can be transferred. To do this, tick the checkbox next to the employee's name and click on the  Transfer hours  arrow at the bottom. Confirm in the dialogue window by clicking  Yes .

Planday simplifies the payroll process and offers many options to ensure your employees are paid correctly, even in complex circumstances. This article describes how you can set fixed salaries to your employees. To learn about assigning hourly wages, please go to How to set and update an employee’s hourly wage.  Set an employee's pay by assigning a fixed salary 💡You can’t set the salary for a period in which the payroll period is locked. To unlock it, you can reach out to our Support team. You can set an employee's fixed salary by navigating to  People  >  Employees  > click on the name of the employee and press  Edit  > go to the  Employment  tab > scroll down to the  Salary  section and click on  Edit salary .   From there, you can set the following: Salary amount  - Set the employee’s fixed salary amount. Salary period  -   Choose between  Monthly  (default),  Fortnightly, Weekly  or  Annual.

Salary code  (Optional) - Set a Salary code if you use a payroll integration that requires this information. Expected working hours  - Set the expected number of working hours per salary period. This is used to calculate the daily cost in the Schedule.     By setting  Payroll costs in Schedule , it is possible to estimate how the salary expenses for fixed-salaried employees appear when scheduling. Read more about  How to display payroll costs of salaried employees in the schedule . ⚠️  Please note that the fixed salary employees must have a pay rate of 0 (zero) under  Employee groups: Wage , so they are not registered with double pay.   If you can’t see the Salary section of an employee, it must be because this employee has the same Access level as you do.   Update an employee’s fixed salary If you wish to update an employee’s fixed salary, click on  Edit salary  in the employee’s  Employment tab . Set a new valid from date then click on  Save .   If the new valid from date is prior to any existing valid from dates, then you’ll be asked if you’d like to insert the new salary OR overwrite the future salaries set for the employee.   In the example below, the employee has been earning £2000 per month since 01-02. She has another fixed salary: £2500, which is set to start on 01-05. If you make a new update to the salary: £2300 valid from date: 01-03 you’ll have the following message popping up:   If you choose option 1, the employee will get £2300 until the new salary starts, on 01-05. If you choose option 2, the employee will get £2300 and this change will overwrite the salary that starts on 01-05.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For experienced admins.  Assign a salary to your employees  first. Enable payroll costs in the schedule You can view the payroll hours and costs of your salaried and waged employees in the schedule to help you to plan your shifts effectively.    💡  You can activate the settings for payroll costs to appear on the schedule by going to  Schedule  >  View settings  > and activating  Payroll hours & costs. If you pay employees a fixed salary instead of wages, you have various options for calculating the salary costs in the schedule. In this article, you will learn about those calculation methods and can decide which method to use.   To assign a fixed salary to an employee, see the article  How to set an employee's fixed salary . Select an employee >  Edit  >  Employment  >  Salary  >  Edit salary . In the top section of the edit window - Payroll information - you should see the data entered for your employee's salary:   If salary data has been added, go to the next section  Payroll costs in Schedule. 💡 Remember that the cost allocation and payroll are different. Salary will be reflected in the payroll as a set amount regardless of how you allocate the cost in the schedule. Calculate payroll costs based on Salary amount In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Salary amount .   You can see a direct calculation of this in the lower section, Estimated costs per hour. Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary amount is divided by the number of shift hours in the schedule for the current salary period. When entered in the rota, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works that day. Example: An employee is paid a fixed salary of £2000. The estimated cost per hour - £26.67 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of shift hours in the schedule - in this case, 75. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift in the schedule is given as £160.02 (6*£26.67). 💡  The  Payroll start day  is the day of the month from which each salary calculation will begin. This value can't be set as a higher number because the month of February has 28 days (with the exception of leap years). Calculate payroll costs based on Scheduled hours In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Scheduled hours .   You can see a direct calculation in the lower section  Estimated hourly cost . Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary is divided by the expected working hours in the Schedule. When entered in the schedule, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works on that day. The total cost may therefore differ from the fixed salary, depending on how many hours are assigned to the employee. The actual salary cost will not change for Payroll even if the cost on the Schedule is higher/lower.   Example: An employee receives a fixed salary sum of £2.000 and is supposed to work 60 hours per month according to their contract. The estimated cost per hour - £33.33 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the expected hours worked. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift is indicated in the schedule as 200.00£ (6 * £33.33). Calculate payroll costs based on Business days In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Bussiness days . For  Business days , select the days of the week to be included in the calculation.  For  Show in Schedule for , select the department in which to display the salary costs. In the lower area,  Estimated daily cost , you can see a direct calculation. Optional: You can change the day of the month from which the salary is calculated at  Show cost calculation each month, starting from . Confirm your selection by pressing  Save . The estimated daily cost is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of opening days in the  Pay period  (by default: Monthly). The estimated daily cost may vary from month to month, depending on the business days in the period.   Don’t show (default) By default, the option  Don't show  is set. This means that the fixed salary is not taken into account when calculating the total payroll costs on the schedule. However, it remains added for the Payroll export data.   Need more help?

If you are outside your workplace or at the wrong location, go back and try again. Ensure that you're connected to the correct company Wi-Fi Your employer can optionally restrict the use of the Punch Clock to an approved Wi-Fi network of their choice.

If you’d like to use the Punch Clock with a fixed IP address, see how to  add/update your IP address here.    What is a Punch Clock Activation code? A Punch Clock Activation code is a unique identifier that’s created once a device is activated with it. It is stored on the device itself.   Punch Clock Activation Codes enable you to set up access to  PunchClock.Planday.com  on specific devices on locations with  dynamic IP addresses  (fixed IP is not required).   This will enable you to set up a tablet of any kind or web browser with the  Web Punch Clock  interface, allowing your employees to punch in.    Please contact Planday support team if you want to enable the Activation codes feature bypassing the IP addresses for your Web Punch Clock. Once enabled, you will see the ability to generate activation codes for Punch Clock profiles. See below how to generate them. How can I set up a Punch Clock Activation code? ⚠️  Before setting up your Activation codes, you must create one or more  Punch Clock profiles  on your Planday account.

Some of my Departments use a fixed IP address while others use a dynamic IP address. What do I do? When Punch Clock Activation Codes are used for multiple locations/Departments, the same validation method must be used for all locations, so  either  IP validation  or  Punch Clock Activation Codes validation. You would then need to use: either IP validation and  set different fixed IPs  for your Departments or Punch Clock Activation Codes validation and set all your Departments with one profile for each.

Act on employee comments from the Punch Clock. Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 This article is for beginner admins.  Here's a quick guide on  setting up Punch Clock  if you haven’t configured it already. The  Punch Clock  feature helps you stay in control of work attendance. You can use it to compare scheduled shifts to worked shifts and map out what to improve in your schedule.     With Punch Clock enabled, you can approve timesheets for payroll directly in Planday. Punch Clock is available on the web platform, the stand-alone  Kiosk app , and the  Planday app . How to approve Punch Clock entries in Planday You can approve Punch Clock entries using the  Pending actions  widget on the front page or by going to  Schedule  >  Punch Clock .   The Punch Clock page allows you to review and approve entries (shifts) per week or day, see approved shifts, and get a daily or weekly overview of approved vs unapproved stats. On the  Approve per week  (or  per day ) page, you will find all the clocked entries or shifts needing approval by a  Schedule manager or Admin .   Shift time  - This is the originally scheduled shift time. Punch time  - This is the actual punch-in and punch-out time. Start  &  End : These are times to be approved for payroll. This will differ from the punch-in/out times if you use  rounding rules . If there is no punch-out time, in case an employee forgets to punch out, this will be indicated by a red flag. You can manually enter a time in the End box and approve the Punch Clock entry. Adding an  End  time for a Punch Clock entry will also end the shift the employee forgot to punch out of. This is particularly useful if the Punch Clock is set up to use geofencing and the employee is no longer at the right location (which prevents them from using Punch Clock).   ⚠️ If there is no punch in or out time, there will be no punch clock entry. In this case it is not possible to manually create an entry, but instead, you should adjust and  approve the shift from the  Schedule .    Lastly, If these fields cannot be edited, it is because  deviation rules  are in place and you must decide if you want to use them to account for overtime or undertime.   Length  - This indicates the total length of the shift.   A single shift cannot be longer than 24 hours; if this happens, you must split the   shift before approving. Break  - This box is selected by default if you use automatic  breaks .   You should untick this box if an employee did not take a break. Comment  - You can see any remarks about the shift from the employee, upon punching in or out. Encourage your employees to leave a comment if they deviate from the scheduled shift. Selection box  - With the selection boxes you can pick which entries should be approved. Press the box on the top to bulk-select all entries for approval.  Alternatively, you can select individual entries for approval by checking the box in front of individual punch times. Once you have made the necessary corrections, press  Approve selected  to finalise the selected entries. Similarly, when an entry needs to be removed, select it from the list and press  Delete selected . Once these shifts are approved, they are ready for payroll. Approved shifts and Punch Clock entries can be found under the  Approved  tab,  Overview per day  or  Overview per week . 💡 Please note that if you use an ePOS integration, such as  Tevalis , the Punch Clock data will only appear in Planday once the user has clocked both in and out for their shift. How to approve Punch Clock entries using the Planday app As a  Schedule Manager or Admin , you can adminster the clocked shifts from the  Planday app . Besides being able to punch in or out yourself from a scheduled shift, you can supervise and approve your employees' Punch Clock entries. ⚠️  Please note that approving of Punch Clock entries on the Planday app is available for all Planday organisations except those using  Deviation rules . As you open the Planday app, whenever a new entry needs your attention, it will immediately appear in your  Requests  widget, under  Punch Clock entries  and also under  More  >  Requests > Punch Clock entries .   Tap on the  Punch Clock entries  to view the entries pending your approval. You will have a quick rundown of each entry and the option to  Approve  on the spot. You'll get a confirmation and the entry will disappear from the list.   The list will contain Punch Clock entries for  completed  and  ongoing Shifts , so you can add an end time and approve an employee's shift if they didn't punch out themselves. 💡  Unlike on the web, the mobile app does not support adding payroll supplements manually or splitting shifts longer than 24 hours for Punch Clock entries. For either of those, please use the web component of Punch Clock. Also, please note that the list of pending entries will only show entries from the last seven days. Log in to Planday on the web to see all the previous entries.   Need more help?   Please search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our ▶️  video tutorials .

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For admins with full access. See  Preparing for payroll . What are Payroll prints? Payroll  Prints  can add extra columns of information to the Microsoft Excel payroll export file. This data can either be taken from the Employee profile, or the Schedule.    For example, you may need an employee's email address on your payroll export so your accountant can send out e-payslips. Your payroll export can include this, customised through payroll  Prints . ⚠️  The customisations you add with payroll  Prints  only apply to the  payroll export's Microsoft Excel and CSV format . Payroll prints do not affect PDF, Dynamic, or Integration payroll reports. How to view your existing Payroll data fields To see existing Payroll prints, navigate to  Settings > Payroll > Prints > CSV/Excel data fields  💡You need to have  admin privileges  to make changes to Prints. If you are an admin and cannot find the Prints tab, contact our support team to have this enabled on your Planday. Each entry on the list displayed here represents a column on your current payroll report (only for Microsoft Excel format).   The  Name  of the field is customisable and will show as the column header on the payroll report, while the  Standard CSV/Excel data field  is the type of data that will be brought into this column.   Through  Sort order,  you can organize how the columns will appear on the report, on the smallest number first and largest last basis. We recommend adding increments of 10 so that you can easily edit the order in case you need to change it in future.    How to create a new Payroll data field To create a new entry in the Payroll prints, navigate to  Settings > Payroll > Prints > CSV/Excel data fields  and press  Create.  Choose from the  Excel data field  dropdown list the field you need to create. This will show all the information you can bring into your payroll report.   In this example, an Email address field needs to be added to the payroll export file.   Any Data field marked with a person icon will contain personal data from the employee profile, while the other type will be scheduling data (marked with a board-like icon). This allows you to create a comprehensive payroll report with both employee and schedule data.   Select the  data   field  you need, give it a  name  (so you can easily find it later), and type the  sort order   number  (a small number would be displayed before a larger one, in the report).   Press  Save  and your new field should appear in the Prints list and on your Excel payroll report from the next export.   Here's how an Excel payroll report header looks when exported with additional fields set up, from payroll  Prints :   How to display the hours for Supplements If you want to display the hours corresponding to Shift types or Supplements on separate lines, you would need to do the following: assign a Salary code to the relevant Supplements add the data field  Salary code  in the Payroll prints 💡 You can also assign Salary codes to Shift types if for example you want to distinguish the hours as training, sick, or absence. See here  how to set up Salary codes in Planday .    How to display the hours by Employee group Suppose, an employee works in different Employee groups. You’d like the hours for each group to be displayed on separate lines. To achieve this: assign a Salary code to each of your Employee group (link to section in article How to set up Salary codes in Planday). add the data field  Salary code  in the Payroll prints you can additionally add the data field  Employee group name  in the Payroll prints to identify the groups or job roles better An example of Excel file with the hours per Employee group and the hours per Supplement will look like this:   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For Admins and HR Managers.  Before assigning a contract to an employee, consider  setting up contract templates.  This allows you to set up a template of how your contracts can be applied to multiple users using information from their Planday profile with your company’s standard contract rules. Set Contract templates by going to  Settings  >  People  >  Contract setup.   Once at least one contract is ready, you can create and send a personal contract to an employee. This can be done in two ways:   From the Contracts overview screen You can create a contract from the contract overview screen by going to  People  >  Contracts  >  Create contract.   By editing an employee You can also create a contract for an employee from the employee edit screen by going to  People  >  Employees >  press the employee name >  Edit  > scroll to the  Documents  tab and press  Create  under  the contract  section.   Regardless of the path you took to get to the create button, you will reach the Create contract screen. Select the employee’s primary  Employee group  to merge the salary information with the contract. Select a contract template that you may have created. Select the  Contract start date  and a contact person, such as yourself or an HR manager as a supervisor. Click  Next  to compose the contract. On the next screen, you will see, depending on your selection of contract: A blank text editor to compose your contract. A filled-in contract template that you selected from the previous step that you can further edit if you need. An attached uploaded document with merge fields that you may have selected while creating your contract. If you are satisfied with the content of the contract, press  Save . You also have the option to download this contract as a PDF file for safekeeping.   The next step highlights the employee that needs to sign the document, shows the creation date of this document, along with expiry date (if applicable), status and two signing options:   Manually : Select this option if the document needs to be signed on paper (printed out) or has already been signed, and a copy should be uploaded for safe keeping with the option to leave comments.    Electronically : Select this option if you want the employee to sign the document electronically through Planday.   If you choose  Electronically , you must complete one more step before sending the document to your employee to collect their signature. You must first sign the document as the employer.    Allow access to Planday before signing contract Secondly, a decision should be made regarding access to use Planday (and the app) for that employee before they sign the contract:  Yes  means your employee can access Planday whether they sign the document or not. You can set reminders to notify employees to sign the contract later. No  means that when an employee opens Planday through the app, they will be notified that they have a document to sign. They will be guided to read and sign the contract before being allowed further. Select  No  if you want your employees to be made aware automatically when they open their Planday app that they have documents to sign. When done, press  Sign and send to employee  to sign the contract yourself and send it to the employee.    The contract will now be sent to the employee, and you can see it on your Contract overview under  People  >  Contracts under  Awaiting action  section.   You will be notified as soon as the employee has signed the document, which will then move under the  Signed contracts  section. 💡 If you have an already signed a contract that was created outside of Planday, you can also import this on the employee's profile under  Employees  > edit employee >  Documents . See more about  uploading files and documents here .   Contract notifications and reminders To avoid chasing your employees for contract signatures, you can enable notifications and reminders that can be sent automatically.  Employee contracts  allow you to send an SMS or Planday message to specified employees when they receive a new contract that needs to be signed.  Contract reminders  will send a notification if they have failed to sign a contract after a set time. To set up either of these features, go to  Settings  >  Your organisation  >  Notifications .   You can also add a reminder for contract expiration in case the created contract has had an expiration date.   Need more help?

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For advanced admins. Read the  Overview of Payroll supplements  to get acquainted with the Payroll supplements in Planday.   Payroll supplements are an automatic way to add extra payments to shifts or parts of shifts. This can be useful for setting overtime, weekend, or night rates. In this article, you’ll see some examples of commonly used Payroll supplements and how to set them up. Since they are only examples for each type of supplement, you might need to tweak them to fit your needs.    You can create payroll supplements by navigating  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement .    Remember that as soon as you add a Payroll supplement, it might be applied to all the hours in your schedule unless you specify a time range. Make sure to take this into account before you do a pay run. 💡 Please note that payroll supplements will be applied backdated (from the beginning of the payroll period). We recommend that you set them up when a new payroll period starts or very soon after. Normal supplement Normal supplements are best used when rates are affected by specific times of the day.      Weekend supplement In this example, you will be looking at using a Normal supplement to add a weekend monetary rate to the system. Specifically, for all the hours worked on a Saturday or a Sunday, an extra £10 per hour worked needs to be added.   Supplement type : Choose Normal supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easy to identify in the future. Hourly wage : As you want to add an extra £10 per  hour , you need to change the Hourly Wage to ‘£ monetary’ (currency value depending on your Planday setup). Start type : It should be left as ‘ Hour ’ if you want the supplement to be controlled from a start and end time. If you choose the option “Relative to shift” in Start type, it will allow you to start the supplement after a certain number of minutes into the shift. For example, by choosing the value ‘240’, the supplement starts after the employee’s shift has lasted 240 mins (4 hours). Duration refers to how long the supplement should last in minutes. Payment period : Enter ’00:00’ in  Start and End time  as you are looking at applying this supplement to any hour worked on the weekend. If you have a specific time period in mind, you could enter this here. Salary code : The salary code can be set to ‘Weekend supplement’, so it can be easy to identify on the payroll export. Payroll : Add 10 into the payroll box to give a £10 supplement. Days of the week : The days should be Saturday and Sunday Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Night supplement In this example, you will be looking at using a Normal supplement to add a percentage-controlled supplement to the hours the employees work at night on weekdays.   Supplement type : Choose Normal supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easy to identify in the future. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Start type : It should be left as ‘ Hour ’ as you want the supplement to be controlled from a start and end time. Payment period : Enter ’20:00’ in  Start  and ’06:00’ in  End  as you are looking at applying this supplement to the hours between 8 pm. and 6 am. Don’t forget to tick the option “Allow over midnight” further down. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Add 30 into the payroll box to give a 30% increase for each hour the employees work between 8 pm. and 6 am. Days of the week : Choose the days of the week here Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Bank holiday supplement This example shows a Bank holiday supplement that applies a 50% additional pay for each hour worked on a public holiday.   Supplement type : Choose Normal supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easy to identify in the future. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Start type : It should be left as ‘ Hour ’ as you want the supplement to be controlled from a start and end time. Payment period : Enter ’00:00’ in  Start and End time  as you are looking at applying this supplement to any hour worked on a Bank holiday. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Add 50 into the payroll box to give a 50% increase for each hour of the Bank holiday day the employees work. Days of the week : Select none here as the supplement should be applied only on Bank holiday days. Days from the Bank Holiday calendar : Select the relevant  Bank holiday calendar  that includes the days when the supplement should apply. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Weekdays (specific time range) This example shows a supplement that applies a 25% additional pay for each hour worked between 7 pm. and 11 pm. on weekdays.   Supplement type : Choose Normal supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easily identifiable in the future. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Start type : It should be left as ‘ Hour ’ as you want the supplement to be controlled from a start and end time. Payment period : Enter ’19:00’ in  Start  and ’23:00’ in  End  as you are looking at applying this supplement to the hours between 7 pm. and 11 pm. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Add 25 into the payroll box to give a 25% increase for each hour between 7 pm. and 11 pm the employees work. Days of the week : Select the weekdays here. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Week-based supplement Week-based supplements are helpful when you want to create a supplement based on the number of hours someone has worked in a week (e.g. overtime rates).  In this example, employees will be supplemented in a ‘Time and a Half’ manner, so 150% of their rate, when they work over 40 hours a week.   Supplement type : Choose Week-based supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description, so it will be easy to identify in the future. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Payment period (1) : It can be set to 00:00 – 00:00, to include any hours worked on any given day. Payment period (2) : The ‘From’ field related to Hours (in the Payment period) would be 40 in this case, as you want all hours over 40 to have the supplement attached. Then set the ‘To’ hours to a maximum ( in this case, 1000), so all hours of the week will be included in the calculation. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Add 50 into the payroll box to to supplement the wage with an extra ‘half’. ⚠️  Do not enter 150%, as this would actually give employees 250% of their wage, for the applicable hours. Days of the week : Select the days of the week here. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Day-based supplement Day-based supplements can be used when you want to supplement any time worked over a certain number of hours, per single day of work. It could be used if the employees work more than one shift per day.   For this example, when an employee works over 9 hours in a single day, they will receive double the pay for the extra hours.   Supplement type : Choose Day-based supplement Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description. Hourly wage : Choose % as the supplement will be based on a percentage of the hourly wage of the individual. Payment period (1) : It can be set to 00:00 – 00:00 to include any hours worked on any given day. Payment period (2) : The ‘From’ hours should be set to 9 (overtime threshold) and the ‘To’ hours should be set to a maximum (in this case, 24). Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Set the Payroll percentage to 100%, as you want to supplement the pre-existing rate with 100%. ⚠️  Do not enter 200%, as this would give employees 300% of their wage for the applicable hours. Days of the week : Select the days of the week here. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details. Contract rules supplement Use Contract rules supplements if you were manually calculating and paying for overtime. For example, you can  set a contract rule  for employees that calculates and pays them automatically if they exceed a certain number of hours.   In the example below, a Contract rules supplement is being applied to all employees having the  Intern 80 Hrs  contract rule whereby their maximum monthly hours should be 80. Exceeding that 80 hours limit would give them £15 extra pay on top of their hourly rate for each hour worked above 80.   Supplement type : Choose Contract rules supplement Contract rule : Select for which Contract rule the supplement should apply. Title and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description. Hourly wage : Since this will be a fixed increment, select ‘£ (monetary)’. Payment period : For the supplement to kick in after working 80 hours, set the  From  to 0 hours and the  To  to 20 hours paying £15 extra. The  To  value is the maximum number of hours until which the supplement should be applied for. So any hours beyond 80, in this case the extra 20 hours, will be given a £15 supplement on top of the regular pay. Reset frequency : You can select either per day or per contract rule interval. The selected value of  Reset frequency  determines if the overtime rates should reset per day or if they should follow the interval of the contract rule. Salary code : Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Payroll : Set the monetary increase of £15 to be paid to any hours beyond 80, on top of the hourly wage. Then, you can specify who should receive this supplement, set a validity period and set additional settings. Click on  Overview of Payroll supplements  for further details.   The payroll report would show the contract rule applied when the employee exceeds their 80 scheduled hours threshold. You can see this supplement applied when you export the payroll report from  Payroll  >  Payroll export  >  Prepare report .   Reset frequency - use case In the example below, the employee is contracted to work 25 hours per week but is working 37h 30min from Monday to Friday. The employee then works 12h 30 min overtime.    The following Contract rules supplement is created:    The employee will be paid an additional 100% of the normal rate for overtime hours and the supplement will apply after 2 hours (1.) Reset frequency  is set to Per day (2.), therefore the supplement will trigger when the employee has worked more than 25 hours per week and will apply after 2 hours of overtime  every day .  The supplement will look like this in the payroll report:   If we use the Reset frequency option  Per Contract rule interval , the supplement will trigger when the employee has worked more than 25 hours per week and will apply after 2 hours of overtime, on  all hours  until the next weekly interval starts.        Manual supplement These supplements are used when you manually want to add supplements to your employees, such as bonuses. It applies directly to the shift in the schedule. You can set a fixed amount per shift or per hour. You can create a manual supplement under  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement  >  Manual supplement > Create fixed manual supplement/Create manual supplement. There are two kinds of manual supplements.  The  manual supplement —  calculated per hour and the amount can’t be edited when the supplement is added to the shift. The  fixed manual supplement —  calculated for the entire shift and you can edit the amount when you add the supplement to the shift. In the example below, a fixed manual supplement is created for the employees who are on call and who have to come and work extra. They would get a £30 supplement on their “Emergency shift”.   Name and Description:  Give this supplement a name and a description Block normal supplements:  Choose whether or not this supplement should block other supplements Employee groups:  Select which Employee groups this supplement should be applied Shift types:  Select the Shift types where the supplement can apply Employee types:  Select which Employee types this supplement should be applied for Bank Holiday calendar:  If you don’t select any days of the week further down, choose the Bank holiday calendar the supplement should be applied to Payroll:  Set the monetary increase of £30 to be added to the shift’s pay Salary code:  Set a salary code to easily identify the supplement on the payroll export. Days of the week:  Select which days of the week the supplement can be applicable. Valid from/Valid to:  Set when the supplement comes into effect or ends.

Once complete, your employees can clock in and out from Tevalis, and their clock entries will appear directly in Planday's Punch Clock. Clock times with a start and end time are automatically fetched by Planday every 5 min for the past 48 hours.    Clock times will be visible directly on the shift or inside the Punch Clock menu in  Schedule  >  Punch Clock . If there is a note attached in Tevalis, it will appear as a comment in Planday with the header: Tevalis integration.   Preparing the integration Centralised users The integration requires that you use Centralised users in Tevalis so that users can be mapped between the systems. This means that your users must be managed in the centralised manager application in Tevalis. This is a prerequisite to identifying the user's clock entries from Tevalis and matching them to the correct shifts in Planday.   After the integration is launched your employees will be managed in Planday and their details exported to Tevalis. The following information will be exported: First name Last name Employee group   Request details from Tevalis Before you can set up the integration, contact Tevalis support to request the following details: Your Tevalis Company ID Your Tevalis Secret Your Tevalis Secret 2 If you are not provided with two different secrets, please make a request to Tevalis support to have their API team create the Tevalis Secret 2.   The next step is to verify that existing users have identical names in both Tevalis and Planday.   If you are already a Planday and Tevalis customer and have your users created in both systems, you need to make an initial sync of existing employees. This will provide the users in Tevalis with an external ID from Planday, so Planday can recognise the users in Tevalis.     Activate the Tevalis integration Connect to Tevalis 💡 If you have several Planday organizations, you can only connect one Tevalis account to one Planday organization. Connecting the same Tevalis account to different Planday organisations will disconnect it.   Log into Planday and go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview . Find the Tevalis integration in the Time & Attendance category and select  Add . Enter the company ID and both of the secrets which you received from Tevalis support. Press  connect . If the connection fails, please check that you have entered the correct connection details from Tevalis. Next, turn on Push employee data and Tevalis Time Clock   Export of existing employees If you already have users in Planday and Tevalis you can make an initial mapping of these users with the following steps.   On the integrations, page open the Tevalis Time & Attendance integration with the Manage button. Next, select Show details and you will see a list of your employees. Select each Employee group that you want sent to Tevalis. Please note that the Planday Employee groups will overwrite existing groups in Tevalis. Finally, select the Push now button to export the users to Tevalis. Users that already exist in Tevalis will be updated with the Employee group and external ID. Employees that do not yet exist in Tevalis will be created.   New employees Going forward, new employees only need to be created in Planday. Then, instead of also creating the same user in Tevalis, you will simply go to the Tevalis Time and Attendance integration on the integrations page in Planday and select the Employee group the new employee is in. Here you can use the Push now button to add them to Tevalis.     Start using the time clock integration Importing Tevalis clock times Now that the integration is connected and your employees are mapped between Planday and Tevalis the integration will start importing clock times from Tevalis. Time clock entries will be imported every 5 minutes for the past 48 hours. Please note that only time clock entries with both a clock in and a clock out time in Tevalis are imported.   Automatic breaks set up in Planday will be applied to shifts with time clock entries imported from Tevalis. Please note:  Manual breaks in Planday will not work with this integration. Please note:  Clock in and out in Tevalis for breaks will not work with this integration. Planday  rounding rules  will be applied to the imported time clock entries from Tevalis when they are matched to a shift in Planday.    How time clock entries from Tevalis are matched to shifts in Planday If you are curious to understand how time clock entries are matched to the specific shifts in Planday, you can review the set of rules that determines this below.   If an employee has 1 shift on a day, the time clock entries are matched to the shift regardless of the difference between the clock times and shift times. If an employee has 2 consecutive shifts on a day (e.g. 8-14 + 14-17) the integration will match both shifts by following: Shift 1: Time in – 14 Shift 2: 14 – Time out If an employee has 2 non-consecutive shifts on a day, the integration will work as below: If both the clock in/out times have a difference of less than 1 hour, it will match the shifts. If punch in exceeds a 1-hour difference and punch out has less than a 1-hour difference for the shift times, it will match the shift. If the clock in has less than a 1-hour difference and the clock out has more than a 1-hour difference from the shift times, it will match. If both punch in and punch out times exceed an hour difference from shift times, it will NOT match to any shifts. In this case, no time clock entry is imported, and you will have to verify the punch times with the employee and manually update the times in Planday. You're now ready to start using the integration so you can approve shifts when your employees' time clock information from Tevalis arrives in Planday!   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents Punch Clock deviation rules can help you automate some administrative tasks for shifts that differ from their scheduled punch times. Once you have configured the rules, Planday keeps track of your employee's hours and the changes between their actual and scheduled hours. The deviations will show as suggestions along the rest of the shift in the  Punch Clock approval  to be approved by an admin or schedule manager.   With deviation rules, you can configure Planday to automatically: differentiate the hours worked before or after the scheduled hours. track and calculate the average of the deviations in working hours, for each employee, over time. calculate the effect on salary at the end of a salary period for each employee. ⚠️  Note that using  Rounding rules  in your Punch Clock may conflict with applying deviation rules. You may need to turn them off or configure Rounding rules to start only with carefully calculated durations. How to create a deviation rule To begin with, create a deviation rule by going to   Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Deviations from scheduled time  >  Create Configure a deviation type After pressing  Create , you can choose which scenarios you want to track and what to happen when the selected scenario occurs. You can make changes later if the initial setup does not suit your scheduling needs.   Name  - This will be used as the name in the deviation rules list.   Deviation type  -   The different deviation types describe different scenarios where you can define what should happen when the scenario occurs. Below you can read more about what the different types are used for. Arrives early  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between punching in before and the scheduled start time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching in happens at 9:30 am, rules of this type will affect the time from 9:30 am to 10 am. Arrives late  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between the scheduled start time and punching in later than the planned time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching in happens at 10:30 am, rules of this type will affect the time from 10 am to 10:30 am. Leaves early  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between punching out and the scheduled end time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching out happens at 5:30 pm, rules of this type will affect the time from 5:30 pm to 6 pm. Leaves late  is used when you want to determine what should happen with the time between the scheduled end time and punching out. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and punching out happens at 6:30 pm, rules of this type will affect the time from 6 pm to 6:30 pm. Shift length not reached  determines what should happen when an employee hasn’t been at work long enough on a given day. The timesheet must have a start and end time to calculate the shift length for this type. This type matches if the punch time length is less than the actual shift length.  This type is not affected by the placement of the shift and the Punch Clock entry. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4 pm, the employee has been working for the correct 8 hours and rules of this type will not generate any deviations. On the other hand, if the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 3:30 pm, 30 minutes of work is missing and rules of this type will generate a deviation from 3:30 pm to 4 pm. Shift length exceeded  is used to determine what should happen when an employee has been at work for too long on a given day. For this type, the shift must have a start and end time to calculate the shift length. This type matches if the punch time length is greater than the actual shift length.  This type is not affected by the placement of the shift and the punch time. For example, if the shift is from 10 am to 6 pm and the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4 pm, the employee has been working for the correct 8 hours and rules of this type will not generate any deviations. On the other hand, if the Punch Clock entry is from 8 am to 4:30 pm, the employee has been working 30 minutes extra and rules of this type will generate a deviation from 4 pm to 4:30 pm. 💡  Note that rules concerning  shift length  always have the  highest priority  compared to other types. When a rule related to the shift length has been matched with a shift, all other rules will be ignored for this shift. Final shift type  - Defines the  Shift type  that will be applied to the new shift made by the deviation. For example, if an employee stamps out too late, it can generate overtime according to a deviation rule. See the example below for this use case. Minimum length  - Defines the minimum number of minutes the deviation must be before this rule processes it. 0 means that the rule affects all deviations. Start of shift  - Defines from where in a deviation this rule should start, as time in minutes. 0 means that the rule should apply to the whole deviation. Length  - Defines how long a deviation of this rule should be treated as time in minutes. 60 would mean 1hr.  Depending on your requirements, you can limit your Deviation rules to only apply under certain conditions. You can set them using the following settings. By default, the rule applies to  All  shifts and employees. Shift types  - Apply the rule only to specific  Shift types .  Departments  - Apply the deviation rule only to certain  Departments . Employee groups  - Limit the deviation to only certain groups of employees by selecting an  Employee group . Employee types  - Apply the rule only to some  Employee types . Remember to press  Save  and continue the same process for all desired Deviation rules you create. Example of a shift length exceeded deviation rule  To show how deviation rules work in practice, here is an example with the type  Shift length exceeded .   First, the rule is created by going to  Settings  >  Punch Clock  >  Advanced  >  Deviations from scheduled time  >  Create .    This deviation type is used when you want to specify what should happen when an employee has been at work for too long. You want to count his hours towards an overtime account by applying a Shift type, a final shift type is chosen here that provides overtime, ie. “+”, On the Time Off Account.    In this example, the  Shift type   Flex + (100% ) is applied and it is set to generate overtime as defined under  Settings  >  Absence  >  General .   The  Minimum length  is set to 15. This is the minimum number of minutes the shift must be exceeded before the rule takes effect.   The  length  is set to 120 minutes which indicates that the rule is valid for up to 2 hours.   Example shift with deviation rule applied in Punch Clock & Schedule In the following example, the employee has a shift from 16:00-21:00. He stamps in 30 minutes before the start of the shift and stamps out 35 minutes after the end time of the shift. This gives a total of 1 hour and 5 minutes affected by the above deviation rule. Under  Schedule  >  Punch Clock,  you can see how the shift is divided up if the deviation rule is used. The first 5 hours have the shift type Normal and the remaining time of 1.05 hours has automatically been given the shift type Overtime (Flex +). According to the setup, this type of shift will generate additional time for the timeoff account if an administrator approves the deviation. In the Punch Clock overview, the shift before approval will look like this where 5 hours are considered as normal scheduled hours and the extra 1.05 hours are split and counted as overtime. On the  Punch Clock approval  page, you can choose whether you want to use the deviation rule by selecting between Yes or No before approving the hours for pay. When the shift is approved, you can see the division in the shift schedule as shown below: Need more help?   Please search for answers in the 🔍  Help Center  or watch our ▶️  video tutorials .

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For admins looking for alignment on processing payroll. What is a pay period? The  pay period  determines how often the employee will be paid both hourly and fixed salaries.   You can set a pay period for each employee by going to  People  >  Edit employee  >  Employment  >  Pay periods . The default pay period is  Monthly , which is pre-selected for all your employees unless you change it.   When processing your payroll from  Payroll  >  Payroll export , you can select which pay periods to include in your report.   Which pay period should you set? You probably already have a pay period that works for your business and your region’s market requirements. Besides the default  Monthly  option, Employees may prefer to be paid more frequently on a  weekly  or  fortnightly  schedule giving them quick budgeting possibilities. However, it can be time-consuming to have to run payroll at a more frequent interval if you have many employees.   You have the following options to choose from when setting a pay period: Monthly  - (default) - Employees get their hourly salary calculated for the month or earn a fixed income. This option is suitable for fixed-salaried employees. Fortnightly  - also known as  bi-weekly  or  every other week pay period . Employees get their hourly salary calculated for two weeks. This option is suitable for hourly paid employees. Weekly  - You can use this to pay your hourly or fixed-salaried employees on a weekly basis. Four-weekly  - You can choose this option if you pay your employees after four weeks (as opposed to every calendar month). This option is suitable for hourly paid employees. How to set or change an employee’s pay period? While choosing a pay period when starting a new business may be easy, changing to a new period for existing employees can also be accomplished very quickly. You can change an employee’s pay period by navigating to  People  >  Employees  > click the name of the employee and press  Edit  > go to  Employment  tab > scroll down to the  Pay period  section. 💡 When changing a pay period, you must specify when that pay period should come into effect. Set this by selecting a future date under  Valid from.  The change will go into effect from 00:00 of the selected day.   How to set or change an employee’s Salary? You can set or change an employee's salary by navigating to  People  >  Employees  > click the name of the employee and press  Edit  > go to  Employment  tab > scroll down to the  Salary  section > press  Edit salary .

See  Fortnox integration - FAQ and troubleshooting . Connect Planday with Fortnox to keep your information up to date in both systems and make managing data more manageable and time-efficient. You can manage and sync data with just a few clicks when the integration runs.   This guide will walk you through the steps needed to configure the connection between Planday and Fortnox, including connecting to a Fortnox account and mapping employee data across the systems. Connect your Fortnox account This will open a new view where you need to configure the integration. Activate the integration by pressing the toggle. In the Accounts section, press  Add , which will redirect you to Fortnox's login page, where you need to log in to your Fortnox account.   After logging in, you can review the requested permissions and authorise the connection to Planday. 💡 You must have  sysadmin  rights in Fortnox to authorise the application. If you do not already have one, you must obtain a Fortnox integration license. (More information on the Fortnox pricing  page ). When the authorisation is successful, you'll be redirected back to Planday on the integration settings page. Open the Fortnox integration again by pressing  Manage . You should now see the account name you just connected listed in the  Accounts  section. With at least one Fortnox account connected, you can go on to match the employee data between Planday and Fortnox.   Create an employee data mapping For the integration to work as intended, you need to set up an employee mapping to ensure that the employee information in Planday matches their corresponding employee data entries in Fortnox. This is required to enable integration and guarantee that the data will be synced correctly between the two systems.   From the Fortnox integration settings page, in the  Employee data  section, press  Create mapping .   Next, select one of your connected  Fortnox accounts . If you have any employee records in Fortnox that do not yet exist in Planday, those can be created automatically. That is why the next step is to select a Department in Planday for the new employee data.  💡  You can change an Employee's department later by going to  People  >  Employees  and clicking their name to edit their information. Verify employee data mapping Once the data is loaded, it will be displayed for you to verify and confirm or fix any inconsistencies before the mapping is created.   This list should contain the employee entries from Planday (with their salary identifier), their counterpart entry from Fortnox (with their employee ID), and the sync status between the two systems.   Matching existing employees Suggested matches: The automatically matched suggestions are marked by a blue link icon. Based on the employee's username (email address) in Planday and their email address in Fortnox. It can also be based on their ID when the Planday salary identifier matches their employee ID in Fortnox. Manual matches: Also marked by a blue link icon. For employees with data in both systems but for which the email or the salary identifier does not match, you can create a link from the  Add employees  button. Once added to the mapping their profiles match accordingly in the list, the blue link icon should show, confirming their status.  After you click  Add employees , you can switch between two lists of employee data entries, from Planday and Fortnox.  After selecting which employees to add to the mapping from the lists, click  Save . If no employees on the list need to be added or you don't have changes to make, click  Cancel  to return to the previous view. ⬆️ A red warning icon next to an employee entry means that information is missing from some fields. Please keep in mind to check that the Planday required fields for employee data are not empty when creating a mapping between Fortnox and Planday. You can check and configure the required property for the data field in  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup .   Importing employees Marked by a  green  icon.  If data for an employee only exists only in Planday or only in Fortnox, you'll also need to add them manually. Click the  + Add employees  button, select the employees available from either list and then press  Save . This will create a new employee entry in Planday or Fortnox.  Please note that different data fields may be required in each system, and those cannot be empty. If a required field is empty, a red warning icon will appear next to that employee’s name. This means that you will not only be able to create a new employee entry before all the required fields have relevant data. However, you would be able to map that employee to an already existing entry. You can read more about it in the  Fortnox FAQ article . 💡 At any point during the process, you can check out the  Summary  box on the right-hand side. This shows the number of employees grouped by status and reflects what will happen when the integration is saved. If you hover over the info icon in the Summary box, you'll get a list of what information with be synced from Planday to Fortnox when updated in Planday. Once you match employee records from the two systems, you're ready to add the mapping to your integration. Press  Add to integration  button in the top right corner.   Editing or deleting employee mappings You can always change the mapping you created between the two systems by going to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview ,   finding the Fortnox Integration, and then clicking  Manage.   Under  Employee data , you'll find the existing mappings. Click anywhere on the row or hover over the row and select the  Edit  ( ✏️ ) icon.   Here, you can select a new default Department (within Planday) or continue to edit the existing mapping by clicking  Sync .  Similar to creating an employee mapping, you can fine-tune the individual employee mappings. You might notice a grey icon in the Status column when editing an employee data mapping. This indicates that the mapping for that employee has already been created. Additionally, some employees may have a  yellow  icon as their Status, representing that their profile has been deactivated in Planday. If you want to exclude employees from your existing mapping, you can remove them one by one from the  X  icon on their row. Once you're done with the necessary changes, click  Save .   If you want to  delete an employee mapping entirely  (or remove the mapping for all the mapped employees at once), click the Delete ( 🗑 ) icon by hovering over the name of the mapping.   Additional Employee data settings You'll notice two options turned on by default in the  Employee data  section. Here is what they do: Keep Fortnox up to date with employee data from Planday -  Synchronise the changes to employee data fields from Planday to Fortnox. (Changes are synced instantly to Fortnox.) Keep Planday up to date with the latest pay rates and monthly salaries from Fortnox -  Synchronize the hourly rates and fixed monthly salary rates from Fortnox to Planday  (daily sync at 03:00 am). Here, you can also see a quick overview of your existing mapping. This includes the Planday Department where the newly added employees will be created (if any) and a reference for how many employees have their data included in the mapping.

Here's what's new: Web:  Improvements to the Schedule page The schedule page received an update to improve the  visibility of bulk actions . Instead of icons, you now have buttons with text indicating the actions:  Edit ,  Approve ,  Set shifts to open , and  Delete .  When a Shift type does not allow for a break, the option to add a manual break to that shift has been removed from the schedule. This change clarifies what is sent to payroll regarding break data when marking shifts that do not require breaks. (For example, sickness, maternity or short shifts.) Improvements to the Schedule template editor It’s now possible to perform the following  bulk   actions on multiple shifts at once  in your templates: Edit shifts. Set shifts to open. Delete shifts.   Added the option to add comments to shifts in the Schedule template.  This means that schedule managers can prepare helpful information to go out to employees. Shift comments can now be added to the templates. Manager’s shift comments are copied when they save a schedule as a template. Lightened workload by not having to write comments on the shifts manually after applying the template.  Improved help messages when bulk-deleting shifts The confirmation messages are now updated to provide the exact information as to how many shifts out a total number of shifts were deleted and why some shifts could not be deleted. You now know which actions were taken and which could not be acted. Added option for notifying employees when deleting a whole week. Ability to change from Starter to Plus package You can now  change  your Planday subscription from a Starter to a Plus plan without waiting for processes to complete. If you are on a Starter package and want to upgrade, go to the Account section under your profile > switch to Plans > and press Upgrade under the Plus plan. Instantly access the Plus package's complete feature set, saving time and empowering you to  manage your plan changes  yourself. New payment method: “Direct debit”  will soon be available as a payment method for self-upgrade packages. This feature is being tested with customers in the UK and will be out to other markets soon. Edit carry-over settings on individual leave accounts (UK only) It is now possible to edit carry-over settings on individual Leave accounts (or Absence accounts) like on Leave templates. This setting is now available for admins in the UK and will be rolled out to other markets soon. Go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  > edit an account > and press  Edit  in front of the balance. This allows you to make the following changes to an employee's leave account: Enable/disable carry over. Edit the balance which can be carried over. Edit the date at which the carry-over balance expires. Time blocks added to the Data Center (Pro and Enterprise packages only) Addition of Time blocks option has been added to the Data Center. If the Data Centre is enabled, you can now create Metrics based on hourly data. Planday app:  Optimisations to shift request widget We changed the overview widget to show the count for up to three months’ shift requests only, improving the app’s loading speed. The Shift requests data shown in the Requests screen is not affected by this improvement and will contain all the Shift requests.   Paid break information in Shift details  Employees can now see if their shift  break is paid or unpaid  from the Shift details page, giving them a better idea about the money they’ll earn for the shift. This change is for both Android and iOS app. Optimised People feature for managers and employees is coming soon! To improve the user experience, we are introducing a UI change that enhances usability when browsing and editing employee information. We will move the  People  section under  More  >  Workplace  as part of this optimisation.

In addition, you may want to add your custom field for contracted hours per week, if you have this, to “Personligt_lönefält_8”. If you want to restore the default field mapping suggestions, at any time, you may click the  Reset to default  button on the bottom right. This will reset the fields to the standard. Click the  Activate  button at the bottom left (if your integration was not active yet). Remember to click ”Save“ if the integration was already active. 2 - Create your own report First, you will create your own report(s) based on the template for Hogia. You can name them what you would like and use different filters. Go to  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Export data Under  Integration templates , find the template with the Hogia logo and select  Create report. Give your report a name, and select which Departments and Employee types you wish to include. Under  Filter , you can select to include only newly created, updated, deactivated, or hired employees. The filters are optional. Click  Save . Repeat, if needed. 3 - Download your report When ready to download your Hogia personal and employment data reports, just go to  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Export data . To the left, under  Your employee reports , find the report you want to download. To make sure the report is in the correct format, you should see a small Hogia logo in the top right corner next to the name of the report, as shown in the screenshot below. If you are using the filters, you need to add from and to dates by clicking “Edit” and selecting dates at the bottom. This is to specify the date range for the user creations, changes, hire dates, or deactivation dates to have occurred, for them to be included in this report download. Select  Download , when ready. Your file will be downloaded onto your computer, and you should be able to find it in the location for your downloaded files. If you need to search for the file, please look for a file name that starts with  Hogia_ .   4 - Import the file in Hogia Before you start this step, please be aware that by importing the report Hogia will automatically create new, update, or deactivate employee data in Hogia, based on the data that is in the file. You can open up the file on a text editor to check its content if you are unsure what data is included. If you have questions about how this works, please see the  Frequently Asked Questions  below. When you are ready, follow the steps below: In Hogia, go to  Arkiv  >  Import  >  Anställda  to begin the import. Then select the file that you downloaded from Planday. Please see the full instructions provided by Hogia Help Center (Swedish)  https://www.kundtorg.hogia.se/fraga?id=6256   Frequently Asked Questions Will new employees in Planday, automatically be created in Hogia? Yes, if the file includes a salary identifier that does not exist in Hogia yet, a new employee entry will be created in Hogia. So when you create the new employees in Planday, make sure you give them a salary identifier that does not exist yet.   What will happen if I have updated an employee’s data in Planday? If the salary identifier of the employee already exists in Hogia, any changes to any of the employee fields will overwrite data in the respective fields in Hogia.   What will happen if I have deactivated an employee in Planday? If you have set a deactivation date for an employee in Planday, the employee will become inactive in Hogia on the specified date. This is because the import will make sure that the field “Avgångsdatum” in Hogia is updated with the new date.   Why is the hourly rate field not updated? Firstly, double-check that you have selected the hourly rate field and saved the integration settings correctly, as shown in this guide. Secondly, please check that the employee has a valid hourly rate in Planday in People > Employees > Edit (select the pencil icon to edit one employee or select the employee and click the Edit button) > Groups and Wages. The valid from date on the hourly rate should not be in the future. Also, if the employee has several employee groups, the hourly rate for one employee must be identical in all their groups. If an employee has different rates in Planday, this field will be blank in the file for this employee.    What data does the “Full Bank Account” field include? This includes both the Reg Num (Sweden: Clearing number) and the account number. If you select the Bank Account field instead, this will not include the Reg Num (Sweden: Clearing number).   Can I add additional fields to the report? You can add up to 3 additional pay fields. Other fields are not supported at this time.   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For admins looking to integrate Fortnox with Planday. Are you looking for the Fortnox FAQ? See  Fortnox integration - FAQ and troubleshooting . Connect Planday with Fortnox to keep your information up to date in both systems and make managing data more manageable and time-efficient. You can manage and sync data with just a few clicks when the integration runs.   This guide will walk you through the steps needed to configure the connection between Planday and Fortnox, including connecting to a Fortnox account and mapping employee data across the systems. Connect your Fortnox account This will open a new view where you need to configure the integration. Activate the integration by pressing the toggle. In the Accounts section, press  Add , which will redirect you to Fortnox's login page, where you need to log in to your Fortnox account.   After logging in, you can review the requested permissions and authorise the connection to Planday. 💡 You must have  sysadmin  rights in Fortnox to authorise the application. If you do not already have one, you must obtain a Fortnox integration license. (More information on the Fortnox pricing  page ). When the authorisation is successful, you'll be redirected back to Planday on the integration settings page. Open the Fortnox integration again by pressing  Manage . You should now see the account name you just connected listed in the  Accounts  section. With at least one Fortnox account connected, you can go on to match the employee data between Planday and Fortnox.   Create an employee data mapping For the integration to work as intended, you need to set up an employee mapping to ensure that the employee information in Planday matches their corresponding employee data entries in Fortnox. This is required to enable integration and guarantee that the data will be synced correctly between the two systems.   From the Fortnox integration settings page, in the  Employee data  section, press  Create mapping .   Next, select one of your connected  Fortnox accounts . If you have any employee records in Fortnox that do not yet exist in Planday, those can be created automatically. That is why the next step is to select a Department in Planday for the new employee data.  💡  You can change an Employee's department later by going to  People  >  Employees  and clicking their name to edit their information. Verify employee data mapping Once the data is loaded, it will be displayed for you to verify and confirm or fix any inconsistencies before the mapping is created.   This list should contain the employee entries from Planday (with their salary identifier), their counterpart entry from Fortnox (with their employee ID), and the sync status between the two systems.   Matching existing employees Suggested matches: The automatically matched suggestions are marked by a blue link icon. Based on the employee's username (email address) in Planday and their email address in Fortnox. It can also be based on their ID when the Planday salary identifier matches their employee ID in Fortnox. Manual matches: Also marked by a blue link icon. For employees with data in both systems but for which the email or the salary identifier does not match, you can create a link from the  Add employees  button. Once added to the mapping their profiles match accordingly in the list, the blue link icon should show, confirming their status.  After you click  Add employees , you can switch between two lists of employee data entries, from Planday and Fortnox.  After selecting which employees to add to the mapping from the lists, click  Save . If no employees on the list need to be added or you don't have changes to make, click  Cancel  to return to the previous view. ⬆️ A red warning icon next to an employee entry means that information is missing from some fields. Please keep in mind to check that the Planday required fields for employee data are not empty when creating a mapping between Fortnox and Planday. You can check and configure the required property for the data field in  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup .   Importing employees Marked by a  green  icon.  If data for an employee only exists only in Planday or only in Fortnox, you'll also need to add them manually. Click the  + Add employees  button, select the employees available from either list and then press  Save . This will create a new employee entry in Planday or Fortnox.  Please note that different data fields may be required in each system, and those cannot be empty. If a required field is empty, a red warning icon will appear next to that employee’s name. This means that you will not only be able to create a new employee entry before all the required fields have relevant data. However, you would be able to map that employee to an already existing entry. You can read more about it in the  Fortnox FAQ article . 💡 At any point during the process, you can check out the  Summary  box on the right-hand side. This shows the number of employees grouped by status and reflects what will happen when the integration is saved. If you hover over the info icon in the Summary box, you'll get a list of what information with be synced from Planday to Fortnox when updated in Planday. Once you match employee records from the two systems, you're ready to add the mapping to your integration. Press  Add to integration  button in the top right corner.   Editing or deleting employee mappings You can always change the mapping you created between the two systems by going to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview ,   finding the Fortnox Integration, and then clicking  Manage.   Under  Employee data , you'll find the existing mappings. Click anywhere on the row or hover over the row and select the  Edit  ( ✏️ ) icon.   Here, you can select a new default Department (within Planday) or continue to edit the existing mapping by clicking  Sync .  Similar to creating an employee mapping, you can fine-tune the individual employee mappings. You might notice a grey icon in the Status column when editing an employee data mapping. This indicates that the mapping for that employee has already been created. Additionally, some employees may have a  yellow  icon as their Status, representing that their profile has been deactivated in Planday. If you want to exclude employees from your existing mapping, you can remove them one by one from the  X  icon on their row. Once you're done with the necessary changes, click  Save .   If you want to  delete an employee mapping entirely  (or remove the mapping for all the mapped employees at once), click the Delete ( 🗑 ) icon by hovering over the name of the mapping.   Additional Employee data settings You'll notice two options turned on by default in the  Employee data  section. Here is what they do: Keep Fortnox up to date with employee data from Planday -  Synchronise the changes to employee data fields from Planday to Fortnox. (Changes are synced instantly to Fortnox.) Keep Planday up to date with the latest pay rates and monthly salaries from Fortnox -  Synchronize the hourly rates and fixed monthly salary rates from Fortnox to Planday  (daily sync at 03:00 am). Here, you can also see a quick overview of your existing mapping. This includes the Planday Department where the newly added employees will be created (if any) and a reference for how many employees have their data included in the mapping. When you've mapped employees and adjusted sync settings, you can move to the next step and set up payroll.   Next: Manage and sync payroll data to Fortnox   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For administrators with legacy Planday accounts. Most legacy Planday accounts have only male and female options when choosing gender in the  employee setup form . By default, this is a required field that you, as an admin, must fill out, and your employee can choose.   Through consensus, we have reached a solution that gives you and your employees control while keeping the current setup for clients who need this field mandatory. Here is how you can change it for your Planday setup with a few easy steps.   How to archive the current gender field Start by going to your Employee field setup form via  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup . Press the  Archive field  button on the row of the existing Gender field.   Once archived, the field will be moved to the  Archived fields  section at the bottom of the employee form, and the legacy choice is no longer visible on the employee create or edit form nor on the employee profile settings. How to create custom gender field options Under the  Misc section , press the  Add field  link and set Type to  dropdown . As an admin, this allows you to add a custom selection of gender choices for the employees to pick from. Alternatively, you can set the Type to  text , allowing employees to write how they wish to identify.   Under  Access levels , set the permissions to allow you and the employee to edit this field when creating or editing their profile.  You can also set if this is a required field to fill or optional.   Depending on what you set up, the employee can now go into their profile via the web or Planday app and identify their choice of gender.   FAQ's Can I add additional genders to the existing gender field instead of archiving it? No. If you want your employee form to support additional gender options, you can create a custom field as a dropdown with a defined set of options. Or you can add a text option to let your employees write how they wish to identify. If you add a custom gender selection in your employee form, archive the legacy gender field and replace it with your custom field. Are any integrations affected by removing the gender field? Some legacy payroll integrations may require mapping employees to a fixed gender field. Please check the syncing requirements of your integration if you work with a service that requires a gender field to be present when sending employee data. This will help ensure that the necessary data is transmitted correctly and that all relevant fields are included in the integration process. Can the newly created gender field be put back in the Information section? When you archive the old gender field, a new custom field can only be created in a section such as Miscellaneous or Payroll.  Need more help?

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For advanced admins and developers: If you want to integrate your system with Planday using our Open API, visit  OpenAPI.Planday.com . You can discover the API's core functionalities, best practices, and authorisation flow there. Planday's Open API allows you to connect with other online services, creating a more robust integrated solution to serve your customers better.   Please note that all steps in this guide require an Admin  access level  on Planday and an eligible subscription package (Pro or Enterprise).   Connect an Open API app with a known Application ID If another system's integration setup step instructed you to connect their application to Planday and provided you with an application ID, you can enter it by navigating to  Settings  >  API access  >  Connect App  button.   Once you insert the application ID provided by the other system and click  Save ,   the app will appear in your application list. To obtain the application's token, click  Authorise , review the permissions you're providing to the application, and confirm by clicking  Authorise  again.  💡  You can copy the app's token from the tile on the Settings page anytime.   Create Open API credentials The easiest way to access Planday's Open API is by creating a new API application. Go to  Settings  > under the Integrations section, click  API Access  > click  Create App . Add your application's name to the title field and then use the scopes below to determine the data accessible through API using the application's credentials. Once you've made your choice, click  Save .   Your new application will show in the application list. The last step is to grant the application access to your data using the  Authorise  button, then confirm your selected scopes. The application is now authorised, and you can use the credentials on the tile. If you wish to set up the application on several Planday organisations, follow the chapter  Connect an Open API app with a known Application ID  using the APP ID of the application you just created. Reauthorise an app after deactivating an account When you deactivate an admin’s account who previously authorised any of your Open API applications, the systems using these credentials will lose access to your Planday data. This is a security measure to keep your data safe. To reauthorise the Open API applications, open the  Settings  page, select  API access  in the left menu and locate affected applications. Next,  Authorise  the application again and confirm its permission scopes. ⚠️  A new token is going to be generated for the application. You must update the new token value in all systems using the Open API application to access your Planday data. Need more help?

If you do not see this option as a manager, have your Planday admin assign you  higher access . Leave balances How can I export leave balances? Export the available balance of your employees’ leave accounts by going to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or  Absence accounts ).  Adjust the  period  to have the right balance. Select the  account status In the  Filters , choose which  Departments ,  Employee groups ,  Employee types  and  Leave accounts  you want to extract the report for. Then click on  Export  in the top right corner   How can I view the overall accrued balances? You can view them under  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence account).   The accrued balance might appear lower than you expect. This is because the start of the period is set by default to the first day of the current month and not the start date of the spending or accruing period of the account.    In order to see the overall accrued and used balances you need to change the period to the start date of the accruing period until today’s date.   In the example above, the start date of the period is set to the first day of the current month and the balance accrued only shows 0.12 days. By changing the start date of the period to the day when the employee should start accruing days and setting the end date of the period to today’s date, the employee has accrued 3.98 days. If no end date is selected, the system will take into account the  end date of the spending period  of the account. In the leave template’s settings under  Settings > Leave & Overtime > Account templates , if you’ve chosen the requirements for accrual to “No requirements, always accrue”,   you’ll be able to see an  estimation of the overall hours/days accrued  at the end of the accruing period in the leave account overview.   Why is the available balance of an absence account different than expected? Suppose one of your employees has taken many holiday days. However, the available balance in the overview under  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence accounts) is higher than you would expect. It could be that there are holidays approved in the future, and the period you selected in the overview doesn’t cover future holidays.  You would therefore need to change the period end date or remove it completely to have the correct available balance.   The account balance you see depends on the selected period. See this example on Available balance before changing the period:   Available balance after changing the period:   Why can’t I see the initial account balance of a future absence account? If you’re using automatic renewal of accounts and you have a fixed account whose validity date is set in the future, the start balance of this account will show 0 it’s because the period's start date is set to a date before the validity date of the account.  You would then need to match the period's start date to the account's start date.   Why is the available balance different on the app than on the web? On the app, the available balance will include both the approved holiday and the unapproved holiday but if you press on the account, you'll see a detail of:  the balance to date (includes the approved holiday but doesn’t include the unapproved holiday) and the available balance (includes both the approved and the unapproved holiday)    I’ve deactivated an employee and I must pay their remaining holiday balance. How do I do that? You can export a leave account report. To do this, follow these steps: Go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence accounts) Set the dates in the period filter from the start of the accruing period to the day the employee is deactivated Click on  Filters  and choose the holiday account Click on  Export The final column  Leave pay - at the end day of the period filter  in the export will give you the amount to pay.    It’s advised to delete their future holiday in order to get an accurate figure of the accrued leave that they are owed in their final pay. To do so, go to  Schedule  >  Absence requests  (or  Leave requests ) > Adjust the period filter > Choose the statuses  Approved  and  Pending  > Find the leave requests > Edit them and click on  Deny .   Leave requests How can I export my employees' leave requests? Export your employees’ overall leave requests for a selected period under  Schedule  >  Leave requests ( or  Absence requests)  > click  Export.  You'll then be able to choose the date range you want to look at, the type of account (either accrued or TOIL) and the departments you want the report for. Why can’t one of my employees submit a leave request? It could be because of one of these reasons: Does the employee have an active absence account? To check this, go to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts  (or Absence accounts) > enter the employee’s name in the search bar > select the  Active  filter in  Account status  and select the account’s current period. If no account appears, you need to  assign one to the employee first  (no absence request can be submitted without an absence account. If the employee already has an active leave account assigned, another reason is that there is another request that overlaps. You can check this under  Schedule  >  Leave requests  (or Absence requests). If there is another request,  reject it first  before a new one can be submitted. Why can’t I see all of an employee’s leave requests in the Leave Overview tab in the employee’s profile? It’s probably because the wrong time frame is selected.   ⚠️  The start of the period is set by default to the first day of the current month.   To see all of an employee’s leave requests change the start date of the period to the date the account is valid.   How can I make sure the leave requests go to the right manager? Let's assume an admin has access to a specific department and should only be notified when an employee in the same department requests leave. You can achieve this by using the  supervisor feature . Is it possible to book a holiday even if you have not accrued the hours? Yes, it's possible if you have enabled the option  Allow negative balance   in the Absence account template's settings.   Inactive accounts How do I delete Leave accounts / Account templates? You can delete a Leave account template by going to  Settings  >  Leave & Overtime  >  Account templates . Select the relevant account template from the list and click on  Delete . If you only delete the account template, this will not delete the leave accounts created from it, but they’ll become inactive.  Keep in mind that deleting an account template may result in the loss of all associated data.   You can delete a Leave account by going to  Schedule  >  Leave accounts . In the account row, select the delete icon on the far right.    You must first have processed all pending requests before deleting an account. I reactivated some employees but I can’t book holidays on their leave account. What do I do? When you deactivate an employee, their leave account is automatically deactivated and you can’t change the accruing and spending periods nor request a holiday on it.  You would need to reach out to our support team so they can help you make some changes to this account or  assign a new Leave account  to the employee. I reactivated some employees but on a different contract. What do I do with their Absence accounts? You would need to apply a new account and set the start date for accruing to the start date of the contract otherwise, the system will take the hiring date of the employee.     Need more help?

M Written by  Maud   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For advanced admins. If you’d like to see examples of Payroll supplements and how to use them, go to  Payroll Supplements – Use Cases . You can create payroll supplements to automatically adjust employees’ hourly rates or salaries based on set criteria. For example, you may want to pay your employees overtime if they work more than 10 hours during the day by using a  normal supplement . You may want to pay your employees double on certain holidays using a  day-based supplement . Or based on their  Contract type  some employees should be allocated a percentage of their hourly rate if they work on the weekends. How to create a Payroll supplement First, go to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  Payroll supplement.   Here, you’ll have the option to create different kinds of supplements.  If you click on the  Create  button under  Payroll supplement,  several options will be available from the drop-down menu:   1. Choose the type of supplement Supplement type : Normal Supplements, Week Based Supplement, Day Based Supplement and Contract rules supplement. Title : Name of the supplement. Description : Include a description (optional).   2. Define when the supplement should apply Based on the chosen Payroll supplement, different options will determine when should the supplement apply after how many hours at what time of the day and if it should be a monetary increase or a percentage increase. See  Payroll Supplements – Use Cases  to learn more.    3. Define what days it should be applied and when it should be valid Days of the week : Select which days of the week the supplement should be applicable. Days from Bank Holiday calendar : Choose specific days from the  Bank Holiday calendar  in the system. Valid from/to : Set when the supplement comes into effect or ends.   4. Set filters defining who the supplement should apply to Employee groups : Select which  Employee groups  are eligible for the supplement. Employee types : Select which  Employee types  are eligible for the supplement. Shift types : This option allows you to define to which Shift types the Payroll supplement should apply. Contact our support team if you want to enable this option on your Planday.   5. Enable additional settings Affects salaried employees : If selected, the supplement will also affect those with a fixed salary rather than an hourly rate. This may not work with percentage-based supplements. Affected by breaks : If there is a break in the shift, should the break affect the shift time and therefore the total amount of time being affected by the supplement. Select this option if the supplement shouldn’t be paid during break periods. Enforced payment : Enable this to ensure that the supplement is always added to the pay – even though other supplements are present in the same period of the shift. If you don't select this option and two supplements are applied to an employee at the same time, only the one with the highest value will be given. Allow over midnight : Select if a shift goes over midnight, potentially into a day not selected as being covered by a supplement, should the supplement continue to apply on the hours that fall in the next day after midnight. Overview of different Payroll supplements in Planday Normal supplement Normal supplements are used when an employee’s pay rate should be adjusted at a certain time of the day, or after a specified amount of hours into a shift. You can set the increase or decrease in pay rate based on a percentage of a wage, or as a set monetary value. For example, full-time employees should be paid an additional 50% of their normal wage after 8.5 hours of work. Week-based supplement Week-based supplements are used to apply a supplement after a set number of hours worked in a week. For example, you can create a week-based supplement that will apply an additional 50% of an employee’s normal wage after 40 hours have been worked in a single week. Day-based supplement Day-based supplements are used when employees work more than one shift per day. The day-based supplement will account for all hours worked during the day. For example, if an employee works more than 9 hours in a single day, they get time and a half for each hour worked over 9 hours. Manual supplement These supplements are used when you manually want to add supplements to your employees, such as bonuses. It applies directly to the shift in the schedule. You can set a fixed amount per shift or per hour.   Contract rules supplement A Contract rules supplement can be applied to all employees that have a specific contract rule to pay them automatically any overtime supplements. For this type of supplement to work, you should already have  contract rules set up  for different employee types under  Settings  >  Contract rules  >  Create Contract rule.  This governs how many hours an employee should be working and lets you see and compare if they go beyond the contracted hours in the schedule and pay them a supplement.   Personal supplement You can set a fixed amount that your employees can get on a monthly basis.  For example, an employee receives a bonus for being a team leader in a busy period. Seniority supplement Seniority supplements can be added to the original pay rate, either monthly, bimonthly, daily or hourly after a certain length of employment. You can set up a required employment length and the number of days the supplement should be added. Time supplement This is especially relevant for employees who work on bank holidays.  For example, employees can get a time supplement of 150% or 200% on bank holidays. This time compensation is added to their TOIL (Overtime) account. Ifthe option  % (overtime)  is used in the dropdown under Hourly wage when you create a Normal supplement, the Time supplement will show in the section Time supplement.

Enable payroll costs in the schedule You can view the payroll hours and costs of your salaried and waged employees in the schedule to help you to plan your shifts effectively.    💡  You can activate the settings for payroll costs to appear on the schedule by going to  Schedule  >  View settings  > and activating  Payroll hours & costs. If you pay employees a fixed salary instead of wages, you have various options for calculating the salary costs in the schedule. In this article, you will learn about those calculation methods and can decide which method to use.   To assign a fixed salary to an employee, see the article  How to set an employee's fixed salary . Select an employee >  Edit  >  Employment  >  Salary  >  Edit salary . In the top section of the edit window - Payroll information - you should see the data entered for your employee's salary:   If salary data has been added, go to the next section  Payroll costs in Schedule. 💡 Remember that the cost allocation and payroll are different. Salary will be reflected in the payroll as a set amount regardless of how you allocate the cost in the schedule. Calculate payroll costs based on Salary amount In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Salary amount .   You can see a direct calculation of this in the lower section, Estimated costs per hour. Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary amount is divided by the number of shift hours in the schedule for the current salary period. When entered in the rota, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works that day. Example: An employee is paid a fixed salary of £2000. The estimated cost per hour - £26.67 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of shift hours in the schedule - in this case, 75. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift in the schedule is given as £160.02 (6*£26.67). 💡  The  Payroll start day  is the day of the month from which each salary calculation will begin. This value can't be set as a higher number because the month of February has 28 days (with the exception of leap years). Calculate payroll costs based on Scheduled hours In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Scheduled hours .   You can see a direct calculation in the lower section  Estimated hourly cost . Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary is divided by the expected working hours in the Schedule. When entered in the schedule, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works on that day. The total cost may therefore differ from the fixed salary, depending on how many hours are assigned to the employee. The actual salary cost will not change for Payroll even if the cost on the Schedule is higher/lower.   Example: An employee receives a fixed salary sum of £2.000 and is supposed to work 60 hours per month according to their contract. The estimated cost per hour - £33.33 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the expected hours worked. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift is indicated in the schedule as 200.00£ (6 * £33.33). Calculate payroll costs based on Business days In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Bussiness days . For  Business days , select the days of the week to be included in the calculation.  For  Show in Schedule for , select the department in which to display the salary costs. In the lower area,  Estimated daily cost , you can see a direct calculation. Optional: You can change the day of the month from which the salary is calculated at  Show cost calculation each month, starting from . Confirm your selection by pressing  Save . The estimated daily cost is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of opening days in the  Pay period  (by default: Monthly). The estimated daily cost may vary from month to month, depending on the business days in the period.   Don’t show (default) By default, the option  Don't show  is set. This means that the fixed salary is not taken into account when calculating the total payroll costs on the schedule. However, it remains added for the Payroll export data.   Need more help?

Not what you’re looking for? Read about our Hogia schedule report and payroll reports to Hogia Lön  here  and Hogia Lön Plus  here . Follow the steps below to download an export file with Personal and Employment Data in the correct format specified by Hogia. By importing the report in Hogia, you automatically create and update employee entries in Hogia with just a few clicks, so that you only need to make manual updates in Planday. ⚠️  Important! Before you begin, please note: You must make sure that the salary identifiers in Planday match with the salary identifiers (Anställningsnummer) in Hogia. You can edit salary identifiers in Planday by going to People > Employees, select the pencil icon to edit one employee, or select the employee and click the Edit button. Here, you’ll find the field Salary identifier under Payroll. If you wish to include Swedish social security numbers, you must make sure that they are entered in the correct format in Planday. The format which is accepted by Hogia is YYMMDD-xxxx, in which YY are the two last digits of the birth year (e.g. 89,  not  1989), MM is the month with two digits (e.g 04 for April) and DD is the date (e.g. 01) with two digits and xxxx are the four last digits of the social security number. If you wish to include pay in the file, make sure that Planday is updated with accurate pay rates.   1 - Activate and configure the settings   In  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview , open the Hogia integration editor. If it is already active, you need to select  Manage , if it is not active you will select  Add . Under “Personal and employment data report” click on the toggle to enable this report. Then select  Show details  on the right-hand side of the header to open up the advanced editor. Under  Field , you may change the standard setup for the Planday fields you wish to export employee data. We recommend using the default fields as we have set these up based on the file specifications from Hogia. If you do not wish to use one of the fields, simply select  Blank field  in the drop-down list. Scroll down in the advanced editor on the right-hand side to see additional buttons. Select  Add personal pay field  if you wish to add pay related fields to the report. You can select up to three. Each of these must correspond to one of the 25 pay fields in Hogia. If you are using the standard setup in Hogia, we recommend that you map the Planday fields below.  Please make sure to double-check that the personal pay fields in Hogia are set up correctly, and adjust the settings in Planday if necessary:  - “Hourly rate” to “Personligt_lönefält_3”  - “Monthly salary” to “Personligt_lönefält_1”.  In addition, you may want to add your custom field for contracted hours per week, if you have this, to “Personligt_lönefält_8”. If you want to restore the default field mapping suggestions, at any time, you may click the  Reset to default  button on the bottom right. This will reset the fields to the standard. Click the  Activate  button at the bottom left (if your integration was not active yet). Remember to click ”Save“ if the integration was already active. 2 - Create your own report First, you will create your own report(s) based on the template for Hogia. You can name them what you would like and use different filters. Go to  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Export data Under  Integration templates , find the template with the Hogia logo and select  Create report. Give your report a name, and select which Departments and Employee types you wish to include. Under  Filter , you can select to include only newly created, updated, deactivated, or hired employees. The filters are optional. Click  Save . Repeat, if needed. 3 - Download your report When ready to download your Hogia personal and employment data reports, just go to  People  >  Employees  >  Tools  >  Export data . To the left, under  Your employee reports , find the report you want to download. To make sure the report is in the correct format, you should see a small Hogia logo in the top right corner next to the name of the report, as shown in the screenshot below. If you are using the filters, you need to add from and to dates by clicking “Edit” and selecting dates at the bottom. This is to specify the date range for the user creations, changes, hire dates, or deactivation dates to have occurred, for them to be included in this report download. Select  Download , when ready. Your file will be downloaded onto your computer, and you should be able to find it in the location for your downloaded files. If you need to search for the file, please look for a file name that starts with  Hogia_ .   4 - Import the file in Hogia Before you start this step, please be aware that by importing the report Hogia will automatically create new, update, or deactivate employee data in Hogia, based on the data that is in the file. You can open up the file on a text editor to check its content if you are unsure what data is included. If you have questions about how this works, please see the  Frequently Asked Questions  below. When you are ready, follow the steps below: In Hogia, go to  Arkiv  >  Import  >  Anställda  to begin the import. Then select the file that you downloaded from Planday. Please see the full instructions provided by Hogia Help Center (Swedish)  https://www.kundtorg.hogia.se/fraga?id=6256   Frequently Asked Questions Will new employees in Planday, automatically be created in Hogia? Yes, if the file includes a salary identifier that does not exist in Hogia yet, a new employee entry will be created in Hogia. So when you create the new employees in Planday, make sure you give them a salary identifier that does not exist yet.   What will happen if I have updated an employee’s data in Planday? If the salary identifier of the employee already exists in Hogia, any changes to any of the employee fields will overwrite data in the respective fields in Hogia.   What will happen if I have deactivated an employee in Planday? If you have set a deactivation date for an employee in Planday, the employee will become inactive in Hogia on the specified date. This is because the import will make sure that the field “Avgångsdatum” in Hogia is updated with the new date.   Why is the hourly rate field not updated? Firstly, double-check that you have selected the hourly rate field and saved the integration settings correctly, as shown in this guide. Secondly, please check that the employee has a valid hourly rate in Planday in People > Employees > Edit (select the pencil icon to edit one employee or select the employee and click the Edit button) > Groups and Wages. The valid from date on the hourly rate should not be in the future. Also, if the employee has several employee groups, the hourly rate for one employee must be identical in all their groups. If an employee has different rates in Planday, this field will be blank in the file for this employee.    What data does the “Full Bank Account” field include? This includes both the Reg Num (Sweden: Clearing number) and the account number. If you select the Bank Account field instead, this will not include the Reg Num (Sweden: Clearing number).   Can I add additional fields to the report? You can add up to 3 additional pay fields. Other fields are not supported at this time.   Need more help?

See  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 1 . FAQs What data will be synced during payroll sync? Hours, supplements, meal deductions, and meal contributions with supported cause codes and salary codes will be transferred to Fortnox only for the employees included in the mapping between Planday & Fortnox.    Pay rates or monthly salaries will not be synced to Fortnox, but depending on your integration settings, Planday can fetch pay rates and salaries of mapped employees from Fortnox to Planday daily at 03:00 am. 💡Please keep in mind that there might be differences between pay rates in Planday Preview and the rates in Fortnox. Can the old file export still be used? The file export can still be used for other Swedish payroll systems, but we recommend using the dedicated  integration for Fortnox  sync since it supports the functionality of the file export and much more. Does the payroll sync include the worked hours of salaried employees? Yes, but this needs to be set up per employee in Planday. Read more in the  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 2  article. What kind of allocation method is used when monthly salaries are synced from Fortnox? Scheduled hours. Will newly created employees in Fortnox automatically be added to Planday? No, employee accounts will not be automatically created in Planday. If you wish to push Fortnox employee data to Planday, you can navigate to the Fortnox integration and choose which employees you'd like to import from Fortnox. Read more in the  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 1  article. Will newly created employees in Planday automatically be added to Fortnox? This is not done automatically, but when creating new employees in Planday, admins can select  Create new user in Fortnox  to send the newly created employee over. How can I add new employees to an existing employee data mapping? When Fortnox is active and running, you can add the employee directly to Fortnox and save them to the existing mapping while creating their account. For your new hires, you'd go to  People  >  Employees  >  Create employee  and fill in their details as you normally would. You will also find a Fortnox section where you can press  Add  to add the employee mapping. Here, you can choose whether to add them to an existing employee entry from the  Fortnox user  dropdown or decide to create a new employee automatically, which also means that you will  not  need to add them in Fortnox manually. 💡 If you have more than one  Fortnox account  connected, you can choose which account the new employee should be added to. Please keep in mind that if you choose to  Create a new user in Fortnox , you will need to make sure that none of the required fields in Fortnox is left empty, in addition to any required fields you might have set in Planday.   At this step, the required information for the employee entry in Fortnox will also be required in Planday, and if anything is missing, it will be highlighted as required when you try to Save.   Once everything is in place, you'll see a confirmation message when you save your employee's data.   To verify, if you click on quick-edit for the newly created employee entry, you will see a confirmation that the employee data is being successfully synced to Fortnox.   However, if the sync fails, a red error message will be shown, explaining what went wrong or how to fix it. How can I verify whether an employee's data is mapped? To check that an existing employee in Planday is mapped in Fortnox, go to  People  >  Employees , find the employee and open the  quick edit view  (✏️ icon).   The employee profile will have a  Fortnox  section, where you can see a label showing the name of the connected Fortnox account. If the data is mapped and synced correctly, a confirmation message will be shown in green.   How can I remove an employee from an existing employee data mapping? Navigate to  People  >  Employees  > select the employee you need to remove and click on the quick edit icon ( ✏️ ). In the  Fortnox  section, click the X icon next to the Fortnox account label to remove the mapping and click  Save  to confirm. Can I include Cost centres (Resultatenheter/Kostnadsställen)? Yes, you can sync data with Cost centre allocation by enabling that functionality in the integration editor and adding your Fortnox Cost centre codes into Department numbers in Planday. Are vacation days/hours from the Absence accounts in Planday supported? No, please use  Shift types  with the Cause code / Salary code “ SEM ” instead. Can I export overtime or flex, or vacation account balances? No. Are manual, weekly, personal or seniority supplements supported? No. What happens if my organisation uses different employee salary identifiers in different departments? The integration recognises only the main “Salary identifier” field, but it is still possible to use the integration. If salary identifiers do not appear to be correct on your employee mapping, you might need to make edits in the Employee form and payroll preview. Does the integration respect the payroll setting: “exclude zero-hours from export” and “exclude salary codes”? Yes. What happens if I have clicked Sync several times for the same pay run period? All the previous data for the same employees for the same salary codes/cause codes and date ranges will be cleared in Fortnox, before new data will be transferred. Which fields are required when I want my Planday employee to be created in Fortnox automatically? Personal Identity Number (PD SSN/Tax ID) Employee Id (PD salary identifier) First name Last name Address1 Post Code City Which fields are required when I want my Fortnox employee entry to automatically be created as a new user in Planday? In Planday, the following fields are always required to create an employee. First Name Last Name Email (used as username in Planday)  In addition, there may be customised settings for your organisation that you may want to keep in sync. You can see or update your  Employee form  settings by visiting  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup. ⚠️  We recommend not to rename system fields in the form to avoid confusion. If you wish to import employees from Fortnox, you must not mark any additional fields as required, as the integration cannot populate custom fields, and the import will fail. What are Cause codes? Cause codes are the equivalent of a Swedish term,  Registreringskoder,  which defines groupings of salary codes that can be found in Fortnox. These Cause codes determine whether the shift/hours represent working time, different types of absence, or supplements.    The data synchronised is grouped by Employee and per Cause code for all pay types, except meal contributions and meal deductions which use  Salary codes  instead.   Using Cause codes can save you a lot of time and tedious work. For example, you do not have to record personal leave and sickness as two different Shift types (with different Salary codes), but instead with one Shift type with one Cause code. Based on the Cause code, Fortnox will use its built-in logic to determine which Salary codes to assign to different hours for sick pay or vacation pay based on the employees’ settings in Fortnox and their current balances. What is a Salary code? Salary codes  in Planday are similar to what Cause codes are in Fortnox. Essentially Salary codes in Planday are used to identify specific types of shifts to match with their corresponding Cause code values in Fortnox. The rate per hour on the monthly salary of an employee shows up as “infinity”. Why? This means that the employee data has no value for “Contracted hours” in Planday, prior to the first monthly salary being added by the integration. In these cases, the  Contracted hours  field is empty, and the system cannot calculate the correct hourly rate. You can fix this by editing the monthly salary and entering a number into the “Contracted hours” field. I encounter errors when I try to Sync my payroll data to Fortnox. What can I do? The  Sync status  will show how many employees could not have the payroll data successfully exported. It will also list any employees whose payroll data could not be synced. (as shown in the screenshot below). By clicking on each employee’s name or the row, you'll see more details about the specific pay items that failed to sync, including: the  date  for the pay item the  type :  Worked hours (regular hours and supplements) Absence (hours from shift types that are categorised as absence) Meal contribution or meal deduction The type can indicate which Shift caused the error. If the error is not immediately apparent, review the checklist described in this  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 2  article or contact our support team for assistance.   I get a *Salary code not matching the Cost code error* when I try to sync my payroll data to Fortnox. What can I do? This could be because one of the cost code values is not in use or misspelt. Please ensure you use the correct cost codes when entering them in the salary code fields in Planday. See the supported Cost codes values here. What Cause codes are supported? When editing Shift types or supplements in Planday, you can use the corresponding supported Cause codes to identify them in Fortnox. Code Description Common Planday usage Type ARB Timlön / Hourly pay Shift data (Shift type: normal) for hourly-paid employees Worked Hours TID Arbetstid / Worked hours Shift data (Shift type: normal) of monthly paid employees Most customers use the setting to exclude this from export. The integration respects that.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents What are Contract rules? Use  Contract rules  to compare your employees’ scheduled hours to those they’re contracted for. Setting these rules allows for better insight into which employees have enough hours, which can be contracted for additional hours, and which ones have exceeded their contract limit. How to create Contract rules First, go to  Settings   >  People   >  Contract rules   >  Create Contract rule   Name the Contract rule, enter a description, and select New interval. If you have set up a Contract rule with multiple intervals, you can set one as primary so it is visible inside the schedule (week, month or year).     Next, enter the values for the Contract rule and Save. The start date set is the day and date from which the scheduled hours are counted. For example, if the start date is set to 1 June with an interval length of 1 week and 40 total hours, we can then expect that 40 hours should be worked from the 1st to the 7th, the 8th to the 14th, and so on. 💡  It is recommended to set the start date to a Monday for a weekly interval or to the 1st day of a month for a monthly interval. If certain  Shift types  should be excluded from the Contract rule, you can deselect them by going to Applies to > Shift types. The example below excludes training hours from the employees’ weekly minimum hours.     How to assign a Contract rule to an Employee  To assign a Contract rule to an employee, go to the  People  page, hover on the employee’s name and select the pencil icon ✎ to  edit .    From the  Personal details  tab, scroll down to the  Payroll  section where you can find the  Contract rule.   Select the required Contract rule from the drop-down menu and press  Save . Using Contract rules while scheduling When you navigate the schedule, you’ll see a colour status on employees with a Contract rule set. The three different statuses described below indicate if the employee is on track to meet their contracted rules: 🟢 Green - The employee is scheduled for the correct amount of hours. 🟡 Yellow - The employee is not scheduled for enough hours. 🔴 Red - The employee is scheduled for too many hours. To show if an employee’s scheduled hours meet the requirements of their Contract rules, hover on the status icon next to their name. From there, you can see the deviation hours, which indicate the difference between the hours specified in the Contract rule compared to the scheduled hours for the employee.   Select the icon to see a more detailed overview of the Contract rule and to switch to different intervals if more than one has been set. 💡  Please note: The scheduled hours for an employee are calculated based on all assigned shifts within the interval date range across all departments. Breaks are subtracted, and if any shift types are excluded from the Contract rule, then shifts with this  Shift type  are also subtracted from the calculation.   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 This article is for employees using the Planday app or the web to request time off. Are you an Admin looking to  register leave on behalf of an employee ?  In Planday, leave from work requests are supported if your manager or admin has set up an absence account for you. Different leave rules for requesting leave from work will apply depending on your company and country. Planday makes it easy to see available balances and request time off from the app. 💡 Requesting leave is not the same as reporting Unavailable. If you want to signal to your manager that you prefer to be assigned to shifts on certain days or not, the  Set availability  function can be helpful to indicate your wishes. How to request leave from the Planday app 💡 The following process is valid for both Android and iOS devices. Slight differences in the UI are described in the article.   To make a leave request from the Planday app, press  More , then  Time off  for an overview of your Absence account balance. Press  Request  (or  +  on Android) at the top right to create a new leave request.    If you have multiple leave accounts, you can choose which account you want to use for this request.   Press the first and last date of your leave period and press  Next  (or  ✔  on Android) in the top right corner to go to the next step. Once the period is selected, you can see an overview of your request, add a comment if you want, and see the cost of each day in your request. Press  Send  (or  ✔  on Android) from the top right corner to submit your request.    Your recently sent request will appear under  Pending requests  until a manager takes action to approve or deny the request.   Your manager will receive your request to be off and can approve or reject the request. You can always check your existing requests on the  Time off  screen or cancel a pending request if you feel you no longer need the off.   How to request leave from Planday web You can also request leave by logging into Planday on the web and going to  Home  >  Your leave overview  >  Accounts.    Press  Request leave  and follow the two-step process to request a leave. You can request half-day leave by inputting  0.5  as the day's value. (Option to request half-day leave is available only via the web platform and not the app)   To see the status of your past or current leave requests, switch to the  Requests  tab from  Home  >  Your leave overview  >  Accounts  page.   FAQs and troubleshooting I am unable to apply for leave Possible reasons: Make sure you have an active absence account assigned. Without it, you won't be able to request leave. If unsure, contact your manager. Check if there's another request overlapping in time. Pay attention to the validity period of your absence account. Requests outside this period won't succeed. Avoid entering ""0"" (zero) days in the absence request. To remove a leave day within a period, submit two separate leave requests. Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For admins looking to integrate Fortnox with Planday. Looking for the Fortnox setup guide? See  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 1 . FAQs What data will be synced during payroll sync? Hours, supplements, meal deductions, and meal contributions with supported cause codes and salary codes will be transferred to Fortnox only for the employees included in the mapping between Planday & Fortnox.    Pay rates or monthly salaries will not be synced to Fortnox, but depending on your integration settings, Planday can fetch pay rates and salaries of mapped employees from Fortnox to Planday daily at 03:00 am. 💡Please keep in mind that there might be differences between pay rates in Planday Preview and the rates in Fortnox. Can the old file export still be used? The file export can still be used for other Swedish payroll systems, but we recommend using the dedicated  integration for Fortnox  sync since it supports the functionality of the file export and much more. Does the payroll sync include the worked hours of salaried employees? Yes, but this needs to be set up per employee in Planday. Read more in the  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 2  article. What kind of allocation method is used when monthly salaries are synced from Fortnox? Scheduled hours. Will newly created employees in Fortnox automatically be added to Planday? No, employee accounts will not be automatically created in Planday. If you wish to push Fortnox employee data to Planday, you can navigate to the Fortnox integration and choose which employees you'd like to import from Fortnox. Read more in the  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 1  article. Will newly created employees in Planday automatically be added to Fortnox? This is not done automatically, but when creating new employees in Planday, admins can select  Create new user in Fortnox  to send the newly created employee over. How can I add new employees to an existing employee data mapping? When Fortnox is active and running, you can add the employee directly to Fortnox and save them to the existing mapping while creating their account. For your new hires, you'd go to  People  >  Employees  >  Create employee  and fill in their details as you normally would. You will also find a Fortnox section where you can press  Add  to add the employee mapping. Here, you can choose whether to add them to an existing employee entry from the  Fortnox user  dropdown or decide to create a new employee automatically, which also means that you will  not  need to add them in Fortnox manually. 💡 If you have more than one  Fortnox account  connected, you can choose which account the new employee should be added to. Please keep in mind that if you choose to  Create a new user in Fortnox , you will need to make sure that none of the required fields in Fortnox is left empty, in addition to any required fields you might have set in Planday.   At this step, the required information for the employee entry in Fortnox will also be required in Planday, and if anything is missing, it will be highlighted as required when you try to Save.   Once everything is in place, you'll see a confirmation message when you save your employee's data.   To verify, if you click on quick-edit for the newly created employee entry, you will see a confirmation that the employee data is being successfully synced to Fortnox.   However, if the sync fails, a red error message will be shown, explaining what went wrong or how to fix it. How can I verify whether an employee's data is mapped? To check that an existing employee in Planday is mapped in Fortnox, go to  People  >  Employees , find the employee and open the  quick edit view  (✏️ icon).   The employee profile will have a  Fortnox  section, where you can see a label showing the name of the connected Fortnox account. If the data is mapped and synced correctly, a confirmation message will be shown in green.   How can I remove an employee from an existing employee data mapping? Navigate to  People  >  Employees  > select the employee you need to remove and click on the quick edit icon ( ✏️ ). In the  Fortnox  section, click the X icon next to the Fortnox account label to remove the mapping and click  Save  to confirm. Can I include Cost centres (Resultatenheter/Kostnadsställen)? Yes, you can sync data with Cost centre allocation by enabling that functionality in the integration editor and adding your Fortnox Cost centre codes into Department numbers in Planday. Are vacation days/hours from the Absence accounts in Planday supported? No, please use  Shift types  with the Cause code / Salary code “ SEM ” instead. Can I export overtime or flex, or vacation account balances? No. Are manual, weekly, personal or seniority supplements supported? No. What happens if my organisation uses different employee salary identifiers in different departments? The integration recognises only the main “Salary identifier” field, but it is still possible to use the integration. If salary identifiers do not appear to be correct on your employee mapping, you might need to make edits in the Employee form and payroll preview. Does the integration respect the payroll setting: “exclude zero-hours from export” and “exclude salary codes”? Yes. What happens if I have clicked Sync several times for the same pay run period? All the previous data for the same employees for the same salary codes/cause codes and date ranges will be cleared in Fortnox, before new data will be transferred. Which fields are required when I want my Planday employee to be created in Fortnox automatically? Personal Identity Number (PD SSN/Tax ID) Employee Id (PD salary identifier) First name Last name Address1 Post Code City Which fields are required when I want my Fortnox employee entry to automatically be created as a new user in Planday? In Planday, the following fields are always required to create an employee. First Name Last Name Email (used as username in Planday)  In addition, there may be customised settings for your organisation that you may want to keep in sync. You can see or update your  Employee form  settings by visiting  Settings  >  People  >  Employee form setup. ⚠️  We recommend not to rename system fields in the form to avoid confusion. If you wish to import employees from Fortnox, you must not mark any additional fields as required, as the integration cannot populate custom fields, and the import will fail. What are Cause codes? Cause codes are the equivalent of a Swedish term,  Registreringskoder,  which defines groupings of salary codes that can be found in Fortnox. These Cause codes determine whether the shift/hours represent working time, different types of absence, or supplements.    The data synchronised is grouped by Employee and per Cause code for all pay types, except meal contributions and meal deductions which use  Salary codes  instead.   Using Cause codes can save you a lot of time and tedious work. For example, you do not have to record personal leave and sickness as two different Shift types (with different Salary codes), but instead with one Shift type with one Cause code. Based on the Cause code, Fortnox will use its built-in logic to determine which Salary codes to assign to different hours for sick pay or vacation pay based on the employees’ settings in Fortnox and their current balances. What is a Salary code? Salary codes  in Planday are similar to what Cause codes are in Fortnox. Essentially Salary codes in Planday are used to identify specific types of shifts to match with their corresponding Cause code values in Fortnox. The rate per hour on the monthly salary of an employee shows up as “infinity”. Why? This means that the employee data has no value for “Contracted hours” in Planday, prior to the first monthly salary being added by the integration. In these cases, the  Contracted hours  field is empty, and the system cannot calculate the correct hourly rate. You can fix this by editing the monthly salary and entering a number into the “Contracted hours” field. I encounter errors when I try to Sync my payroll data to Fortnox. What can I do? The  Sync status  will show how many employees could not have the payroll data successfully exported. It will also list any employees whose payroll data could not be synced. (as shown in the screenshot below). By clicking on each employee’s name or the row, you'll see more details about the specific pay items that failed to sync, including: the  date  for the pay item the  type :  Worked hours (regular hours and supplements) Absence (hours from shift types that are categorised as absence) Meal contribution or meal deduction The type can indicate which Shift caused the error. If the error is not immediately apparent, review the checklist described in this  Setup Fortnox integration with Planday Step 2  article or contact our support team for assistance.   I get a *Salary code not matching the Cost code error* when I try to sync my payroll data to Fortnox. What can I do? This could be because one of the cost code values is not in use or misspelt. Please ensure you use the correct cost codes when entering them in the salary code fields in Planday. See the supported Cost codes values here. What Cause codes are supported? When editing Shift types or supplements in Planday, you can use the corresponding supported Cause codes to identify them in Fortnox. Code Description Common Planday usage Type ARB Timlön / Hourly pay Shift data (Shift type: normal) for hourly-paid employees Worked Hours TID Arbetstid / Worked hours Shift data (Shift type: normal) of monthly paid employees Most customers use the setting to exclude this from export.

Here's what's new: Web: Updated Edit salary form We have updated the form for  editing your employees’ salaries  with a new design and minor improvements. The functionality is still the same as you are used to, but some things are moved around to make it more intuitive for you to use and provide a fresh look and better overview.   You can explore the changes by going to  People  >  Employees  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Edit salary .     Added support for  Salary periods Besides a monthly salary, we now support more salary periods. This will allow you to define the fixed salary amount the employee is entitled to get paid over a year, month, fortnight or week.   The Salary period is selected per employee and can be found under  People  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Edit salary .   For your employees with a fixed salary amount already set up, the Salary period will still be per month. This means that nothing changes in your current setup.     Added support for  Pay periods We are also introducing  Pay periods  for processing payroll, where you can select how often your employees get paid. The Pay periods that are supported are weekly, fortnightly, and monthly. This applies to both an hourly wage and a fixed salary.   From  People  > edit an employee >  Employment  >  Pay periods , you can now select a Pay period for each employee.   The default Pay period is monthly, and this is preselected for all your employees unless you change it. When processing your payroll from  Payroll  >  Payroll export , you can select which Pay periods to include.     Paid breaks From  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Break rules , you can set up  Break rules  that will be added to the Schedule automatically. You can also add breaks manually on a shift-by-shift basis from the  Schedule .  We have now added the option to set a break as  Paid  when creating a new or editing an existing Break rule.   When adding a break directly to a shift in the Schedule, you can also select if the break is Unpaid or Paid.   Paid breaks will appear in reports the same as unpaid breaks, but the employee's wage will not be deducted during the break. Nothing changes in your current setup of breaks. The breaks you currently have are still set to unpaid unless you manually change the type.   App: Improved shift transactions and shift details We have improved the accessibility and layout when you request open shifts, swap or hand over with colleagues, and set your shifts for sale.  Additionally, the shift details now include the time and duration of breaks.   Make sure to use the latest versions available for Android ( 8.1.2 ) or iOS ( 8.1.0 ).    Integrations & Open API: Personio (HR integration for the UK, France, Germany and Spain) With the Personio integration, you can import your employees and their leave data directly into Planday. The data can be imported manually, or you select to have it imported automatically once a day. This way, you will have the data where and when you need it. Read more about  How to connect Personio to Planday .   New Open API endpoints In an effort to extend our API coverage, we added support for endpoints related to the HR API and Absence API. HR API We are introducing a new  Employee Account Management  controller. Using this controller, you can control your employees' credentials and help them access their Planday accounts. Absence API We are introducing  Adjustments  endpoints. With this, you can read and create adjustments on accrued absence/leave accounts to update your employee’s balances. You can find more details on our Open API documentation at  openapi.planday.com . 💡 See regularly updated articles and videos on how to use Planday in our  Help Centre  and  video collection .

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents Whether you work in the healthcare industry or use a Payroll integration, automatically including holiday information in Payroll can be a time-saver.   Setting up a fixed leave account  in Planday is a good way to make sure that your employees get a set number of days/hours off paid out per year, according to their contract and Shift types allows you to send your schedule information to Payroll automatically.   The leave is represented as a shift within integrations like Xero, Sage or QuickBooks. This article will help you set up Planday, so leave-related payout can almost work automatically. Configure Employee types Typically, a Leave account (or Absence account) is attached to an  Employee type . An Employee can only be set to one Employee type at a time, so that makes managing leave accounts a bit easier.   Fixed leave accounts are usually connected to Employees with a monthly salary, as it does not provide holiday costs for Payroll. However, this article will show you how to extract the Payroll information from Fixed leave accounts.   In some scenarios, like in the Healthcare industry, leave is calculated based on the individual's weekly contract ( e.g., Annual leave no. of hours = 5.6 x Weekly working hours). This case fits in between what would be standard practice for using either a Fixed leave account (typically used for the salaried Employee types) or an Accrued leave account (often used for Hourly-paid Employee types).   In the healthcare scenario, an employee with a 40-hour workweek contract will need a Fixed leave account of  224 hours .   To make this work, you'll need to set up an Employee type per weekly contract. Go to  Settings  >  People  >  General , and create your  Employee type .   You'll need an Employee type for each kind of contract (below you can see an example for an organization with only two contract types: a 36 hours/week contract and a 40 hours/week contract). This is necessary because the initial balance in the leave account will be different based on the number of hours/week specified in the contract.   Set up Leave accounts After creating the necessary Employee types, go to  Settings > Leave & Overtime  >  Account Templates > Create > Leave account  and create an account for each of your contracts.    Here's an example of a 40 hours/week contract:   Give your leave template a name. You can choose whether this configuration should renew each year automatically.   Using the previous formula (5.6 x weekly working hours), the annual hourly holiday entitlement for this type of contract will be 224 hours per employee, which means that the  Initial value  on this vacation account is  224 , and the  Accruing in mode  should be in  hours .   It is essential to connect the vacation account to the correct Employee type, to ensure that only the employees with the right Employee type are eligible to use this specific Vacation Account.   You can now assign this Leave account to your employees by assigning their correspondent Employee type via the dropdown menu in the Edit employee window. As a reminder, an employee's profile can be found from  People  > click on the name of the employee >  Edit  > and set the  Employee type.   Requesting and booking a vacation Handling Vacation for an hourly member of staff using a Fixed Account is a two-part process. The booking process remains the same: either the employee sends you a Vacation request, or you can book in the Vacation for them, from  Schedule  →  Leave requests ( or  Absence requests) .    Choose the employee and the date range. Then mark which days should be 'paid' holiday (and deducted from their account balance), and which days should be 'unpaid' (and have no effect on the account balance).    Here's an example for an employee that regularly works 8 hours per day, Monday to Friday (40 hours/week):   Make sure to take a look at the account balance section, to check whether the calculated deductions are correct:   Leave a message if you want to, and approve the holiday. Then move on to the next step to connect the approved holiday to Payroll.    Pay the approved leave As the vacation request on its own has no links to Payroll, you will need to make that connection through Shifts from your schedule. That way, the correct payment will register automatically.    Go to the  Schedule > Employee view  and find the  Vacation . Remember that you can use  Filters  to see only the employees you need. The view should look like this:   For each day of the Vacation period (marked in the Schedule), you will need to create a Shift that uses a specific  Shift type  (for instance, a Shift type called  Holiday monthly salaried ).   The Shift will need a Start and End time corresponding to the number of hours deducted from the vacation account balance for that day.   In the example with the 40 hours/week employee, each Shift would be 8 hours long.   The Shift type and each Shift will ensure that the payment is calculated correctly and linked to Payroll.   To avoid confusion, you should create a specific Shift type and use it only for Vacation payments. You can read more about how to create and use Shift types here.    When you've finished creating Shifts (of the Vacation Shift type), your schedule should look like this:   As you can see on the left-hand side, underneath the employee's name, they now have 40 hours of Vacation time registered for this week, which will automatically be reported to Payroll.

Written by  Patrick Gruhn   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯 For advanced admins. Familiarise yourself with the  Payroll and Revenue  collection of articles. What are Salary codes? Salary codes  in Planday are used to identify and report different shifts, mainly when you use accounting software to process your payroll. They help categorise the shifts and make managing and tracking payroll-related information easier. For example, you can use salary codes to differentiate regular working hours, overtime, sick leave, or any other specific types of shifts for accurate reporting and payroll calculations. When and where can you use Salary codes Salary codes have a hierarchy when placed in different areas of Planday. A general Salary code can be set for all normal Shifts that cover all the hours. This is sufficient under most circumstances.   A Salary code can also be set for each  Employee group . This will overrule the general code to differentiate Shifts belonging to that Employee group.   In rare cases, a Salary code can also be set on each employee's wage. This will overrule the general one and the one set on the Employee group level. 💡  Please keep Salary codes simple and avoid using special characters or punctuation marks, as that may interfere with your payroll integration service. You may use alphanumeric names, for example, Under18 or Full-time, but avoid using complex characters such !partTime&(u18*) €FullTimer%100Pay. How to set a general Salary code You can set up a general   Salary code for all normal shifts simply by going to  Settings  >  Payroll  >  General.  Scroll down to the  Salary codes  section and set values for regular hourly worked shifts, monthly salaried shifts, or employee purchases.   💡   If no value has been inserted in the fields above, the default salary code for Hours worked (as per shifts) is 1201 and for Salary, it’s 1202. These would show in the payroll report. How to set a Salary code on Shift types Another place you can assign Salary codes is on specific  Shift types . This is helpful when you want to distinguish hours as overtime, unpaid leave, sick, or absence.    Go to  Settings  >  Schedule  >  Shift types,  click on an existing Shift type to  edit  and add a Salary code to override the one set in general settings.   In the following example, you can see that all Shifts marked with overtime of 1.5x will be reported under Salary code 1500 so that the payroll software can distinguish those hours from the regular hours. 💡 Note that Planday only reports the hours for that Shift type, not the rate. Apply Salary codes to Employee groups Setting up Salary codes for  Employee groups  can be helpful if you want to differentiate the hours for a group of employees or job roles. For example, employees in a clinic need to be paid a different wage than when they work in the reception vs other administrative roles. You could set a Salary code for the Employee group to differentiate Shifts belonging to these employees.   Go to  People  >  Employee groups.  You can add a Salary code to a new group or edit an existing one. The Salary codes set here will override the one set in the  g eneral settings.   Assign a Salary code to an employee There might be situations where you need to differentiate a single employee's hours separate from the rest of the group. For example, an employee may be paid a different rate due to their seniority in the company, so their hours need to be reported separately in payroll. Setting an individual salary code for this employee would be the way to go, so it overrides the general Salary code and any of the group rates. Go to  People  >  Employees  > click the  edit  employee button on an employee you wish to change > switch to the  Employment  tab > scroll down to  Employee groups  >  Edit . You can assign a personal Salary code to this employee by editing their Employee group relation. 💡 For scalability, we generally don't recommend applying a Salary code on the employee level but use it through  Employee groups  instead.

Create new employees in QuickBooks Online You can also create new employees in QuickBooks Online and they will automatically be created in Planday. They will be created in Planday with the same details as above.   Creating employees from QuickBooks Online requires that you have selected a default Planday department that new employees will be assigned to. To do so go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  >  QuickBooks Online  >  Employee details  >  Show details  >  Select department . When creating employees from QuickBooks Online please be aware that there is a 5 min processing time, before the employee will be exported from QuickBooks Online.     Send Welcome notification When employees are created from QuickBooks Online you can have Planday send them a welcome notification that contains the relevant Planday info. To do so, go to  People  >  Employees  > Select employee > Click on the  Invite employee icon .     Export worked hours Prepare the automatic export of worked hours To automatically export worked hours from Planday to QuickBooks, toggle on Export Worked Hours in the QuickBooks Online integration configuration via  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  >  QuickBooks Online  >  Worked Hours  >  Export Worked Hour s. The integration will send all worked hours from normal shifts by default. If you also want hours from a specific Shift type to be exported to QuickBooks Online, you can select the relevant Shift types in the QuickBooks Online integration configuration. To do so, go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview  >  QuickBooks Online  >  Worked Hours  >  Show details  >  Add shift types .     Export worked hours When a shift in Planday is approved, the worked hours will automatically be exported to QuickBooks Online as a time activity.   The integration supports Break rules in Planday, and only the worked hours will be exported (break times will not be exported).   Unapprove or delete shifts If a shift is already approved and the worked hours have been exported to QuickBooks Online, you can remove the worked hours from QuickBooks Online by marking the shift as Not approved in Planday, or by deleting the shift in Planday. After doing this, the integration will automatically remove the time activity from the weekly timesheet in QuickBooks Online.   Syncing leave data with QuickBooks Planday integration with QuickBooks does not directly support synchronising of leave as a feature. You can get around this by transferring leave data by utilising Shift types on your schedule. For guidance, please see this article on  How to use absence with payroll integration . Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  This integration is for Planday admins based in Australia, the UK and the USA only. With Planday you can connect your  Square  merchant accounts and automatically import revenue data from different Square Locations into Planday Revenue units. Requirements for the integration For this integration to work, two prerequisites in Planday must be completed.   Setup Revenue units in Planday To get this integration working, you must map Planday’s Revenue units with Square’s Locations to fetch revenue data. Before setting up the integration, create at least one Revenue unit in every Department where you wish to import revenue.  To set up a revenue unit in Planday, go to  Settings  > Under the  Reports  heading, press  Revenue  >  Create. When setting up a Revenue unit, make sure to select  Enter daily revenue  for every unit you want to map and also select  Include in total revenue .   💡 For detailed steps, use the  Revenue in Planday  article.   Create Shifts on business days where revenue should be imported Revenue can only be imported into business days of your schedule. To create a business day in your schedule, make sure to schedule at least one Shift for the given day. Setup the integration in Planday Follow these steps to find, connect and configure the integration.   Find and connect the integration Once the prerequisites have been completed, go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview.  Switch to the  Point of Sale  tab to see all available POS integrations or search for the integration name from the search bar.    Click  Connect  on the Square tile to open the integration editor. During this step, the integration gains access to Planday data.   Connect new merchant Connect one or more Square  merchants  (i.e., Square accounts) in the first card in the integration editor.   To connect a Square account, click the  Connect merchant  button, which will open a Square log-in screen in a new window. ⚠️ Make sure your browser is not blocking pop-up windows, in which case the Square log-in window will not open. After signing in, check the Merchants table, which shows your newly connected account. The green status icon will inform you that the connection is set up correctly.   In case of issues with the Square account connection, a dedicated status and an orange status light will be displayed in the table.   Data import settings When at least one merchant is connected successfully, you can complete the integration setup by specifying other settings and mappings.  Start import at  -  Choose an hour.  The integration imports revenue once daily at the hour specified in the  Start import at  field. The imports will take place within the specified hour, typically close to the start of the hour. Get data from the past  -  Choose the number of days.  This field allows you to specify how many days worth of data should be imported. The minimum number of days is 1, meaning the integration only imports data from the previous day. 💡 When selecting more than one day, previously imported revenue on mapped Revenue units is overwritten during every import. It is possible the imported values can change over the first several days as payments get processed on Square’s side. The integration imports only payments marked as  Complete  in Square.   Map Locations and Revenue units Click the  Link location  button in the Locations card to open the mapping window.  At least one Revenue unit in Planday is required  for this step.   The linking page shows all Revenue units and allows you to select any Square Location to map. It is possible to map multiple Revenue units to one Square location and vice versa.   Click  Save  to accept all changes. Alternatively, close the window or click the Back button to discard the changes.   Revenue Import Details Integration timing The integration imports revenue data from Square once a day. The import takes place within one hour starting at the hour selected in the  Start import at  field.  Typically, the import runs near the beginning of the specified interval.    Tax Always Included Integration always imports Gross value from mapped locations. There is no option to import Net value or get information about Tax level or Tax value separately.  Revenue Value The imported revenue is the sum of revenue values of all active Locations mapped to the Revenue Unit from successfully connected Merchant accounts. If any merchant connection does not work, revenue from the merchant’s locations will not count in the revenue imported into the mapped Revenue units.   ⚠️ Note that incomplete revenue values will overwrite correct values imported in the past if a Merchant account connection stops working and if you are importing values for several days in the past.   FAQs and troubleshooting Merchant account needs to be reconnected. In some instances, authorization to the connected account can fail, and the account will need to be reconnected. The user will be informed of that state in the Merchants card where such status will be displayed next to the corresponding account. How do I deactivate the integration? To stop importing revenue, the user must remove all connected merchants. This will stop revenue imports. Revenue previously imported into Planday will not be deleted and stays in Planday.  How can I verify imported values? Verify in Planday:  Open the  Schedule  page on Planday. Press the  View settings  button,  turn on the Revenue toggle  to reveal revenue values at the bottom of each Schedule day.   Revenue imported for a given revenue unit is displayed in the  Daily revenue  pop-up. 💡 Note that the Notes field contains the timestamp of the revenue import and a label of the revenue source. The shown timestamp reflects the  UCT time zone , and it is not adjusted for your Planday organisation’s location! Verify in Square:  Open your  Square Seller dashboard   https://squareup.com/dashboard  and log in using the same merchant account you used to connect with Planday. Navigate to  Reporting , then  Transactions .   Set relevant values in the filter: The date should reflect the period you are checking. Set types to  Payments . Set the status to  Complete . Select the location you want to verify. The value you should compare with imported revenue in Planday is shown in the  Total collected  field. Square sign-in window is not showing Make sure that your browser is not blocking pop-up windows. This can often lead to the log-in window not appearing. If possible, try opening Planday on a different browser. Revenue not importing Make sure that there is at least one Shift in the Schedule on each day where revenue should be imported. Ensure that the  Enter daily revenue  checkbox, located in  Settings  >  Revenue , is selected for mapped Revenue units. Verify that Square locations are mapped to Revenue units of relevant Departments in Planday. Merchant account needs to be reconnected If a merchant account needs to be reconnected, the corresponding status will be displayed on the Merchants card. To reconnect the account, you must click on the account’s table row in the Merchants card. A pop-up window asking you to sign in again will appear. You must log in to the correct Square account. Once you sign in, the connection status will be updated in the table. When an account needs to be reconnected, its revenue will not be imported into Planday, meaning that you might notice unusually low revenue shown on the Schedule. To remedy this, after reconnecting the account, you can increase the number of imported days to overwrite days showing partial revenue figures. Revenue imported to Planday does not match the value reported by Square Check Payments Status  The integration calculates revenue based only on payments marked as  Complete . Since payments can take up to a few days to be processed, it is possible that imported revenue will not correspond to values shown in Square, or that the value shown in Schedule will change during the next import. If you wish to compare values more accurately, filter transactions in Square by the  Completed  status. Check Connection Status  Please check that all connections are in  Connected  status. If a connection doesn’t work correctly, then Payments related to Locations from this connection will not be imported. Need more help?

Once complete, your employees can clock in and out from Tevalis, and their clock entries will appear directly in Planday's Punch Clock. Clock times with a start and end time are automatically fetched by Planday every 5 min for the past 48 hours.    Clock times will be visible directly on the shift or inside the Punch Clock menu in  Schedule  >  Punch Clock . If there is a note attached in Tevalis, it will appear as a comment in Planday with the header: Tevalis integration.   Preparing the integration Centralised users The integration requires that you use Centralised users in Tevalis so that users can be mapped between the systems. This means that your users must be managed in the centralised manager application in Tevalis. This is a prerequisite to identifying the user's clock entries from Tevalis and matching them to the correct shifts in Planday.   After the integration is launched your employees will be managed in Planday and their details exported to Tevalis. The following information will be exported: First name Last name Employee group   Request details from Tevalis Before you can set up the integration, contact Tevalis support to request the following details: Your Tevalis Company ID Your Tevalis Secret Your Tevalis Secret 2 If you are not provided with two different secrets, please make a request to Tevalis support to have their API team create the Tevalis Secret 2.   The next step is to verify that existing users have identical names in both Tevalis and Planday.   If you are already a Planday and Tevalis customer and have your users created in both systems, you need to make an initial sync of existing employees. This will provide the users in Tevalis with an external ID from Planday, so Planday can recognise the users in Tevalis.     Activate the Tevalis integration Connect to Tevalis 💡 If you have several Planday organizations, you can only connect one Tevalis account to one Planday organization. Connecting the same Tevalis account to different Planday organisations will disconnect it.   Log into Planday and go to  Settings  >  Integrations  >  Overview . Find the Tevalis integration in the Time & Attendance category and select  Add . Enter the company ID and both of the secrets which you received from Tevalis support. Press  connect . If the connection fails, please check that you have entered the correct connection details from Tevalis. Next, turn on Push employee data and Tevalis Time Clock   Export of existing employees If you already have users in Planday and Tevalis you can make an initial mapping of these users with the following steps.   On the integrations, page open the Tevalis Time & Attendance integration with the Manage button. Next, select Show details and you will see a list of your employees. Select each Employee group that you want sent to Tevalis. Please note that the Planday Employee groups will overwrite existing groups in Tevalis. Finally, select the Push now button to export the users to Tevalis. Users that already exist in Tevalis will be updated with the Employee group and external ID. Employees that do not yet exist in Tevalis will be created.   New employees Going forward, new employees only need to be created in Planday. Then, instead of also creating the same user in Tevalis, you will simply go to the Tevalis Time and Attendance integration on the integrations page in Planday and select the Employee group the new employee is in. Here you can use the Push now button to add them to Tevalis.     Start using the time clock integration Importing Tevalis clock times Now that the integration is connected and your employees are mapped between Planday and Tevalis the integration will start importing clock times from Tevalis. Time clock entries will be imported every 5 minutes for the past 48 hours. Please note that only time clock entries with both a clock in and a clock out time in Tevalis are imported.   Automatic breaks set up in Planday will be applied to shifts with time clock entries imported from Tevalis. Please note:  Manual breaks in Planday will not work with this integration. Please note:  Clock in and out in Tevalis for breaks will not work with this integration. Planday  rounding rules  will be applied to the imported time clock entries from Tevalis when they are matched to a shift in Planday.    How time clock entries from Tevalis are matched to shifts in Planday If you are curious to understand how time clock entries are matched to the specific shifts in Planday, you can review the set of rules that determines this below.   If an employee has 1 shift on a day, the time clock entries are matched to the shift regardless of the difference between the clock times and shift times. If an employee has 2 consecutive shifts on a day (e.g. 8-14 + 14-17) the integration will match both shifts by following: Shift 1: Time in – 14 Shift 2: 14 – Time out If an employee has 2 non-consecutive shifts on a day, the integration will work as below: If both the clock in/out times have a difference of less than 1 hour, it will match the shifts. If punch in exceeds a 1-hour difference and punch out has less than a 1-hour difference for the shift times, it will match the shift. If the clock in has less than a 1-hour difference and the clock out has more than a 1-hour difference from the shift times, it will match. If both punch in and punch out times exceed an hour difference from shift times, it will NOT match to any shifts. In this case, no time clock entry is imported, and you will have to verify the punch times with the employee and manually update the times in Planday. You're now ready to start using the integration so you can approve shifts when your employees' time clock information from Tevalis arrives in Planday!   Need more help?

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago 🎯  For advanced admins. See  How to configure revenue in Planday. Additional payroll costs are used to get a realistic overview of your actual employment costs by factoring in payroll elements that can add to the total scheduled cost of an employee.   For example, additional payroll costs can be used to forecast holiday accrual costs (through an additional payroll cost of 12.07%) or pension (as an additional payroll cost of 3-4%).   To start, go to  Settings  >  Reports  >  Revenue  and  Additional payroll costs . Click  Create  and you can start to set up an additional payroll cost as a percentage.   The  Create additional payroll costs  editing window appears where you can set the following options:   Title:  Name the additional payroll cost, so you can find it later if needed. Additional payroll costs:  Add in the percentage you would like to inflate the rate by (the percentage you'd like to simulate the costs with). Wage type:  Choose which method of payment you would like to inflate. This can be Schedule costs, such as hourly rates (hourly wage), Shift rates (wage per shift), or salaries (fixed salary). Employee type:  Choose a specific employee type that this rule will affect.  By default, the additional payroll cost will apply to  All  employee types.  💡 If you need to change that, you'll have to save your changes first and then reopen the payroll cost details page, from the ✏️ icon, to edit it.  Description : Optionally, you can write a note to describe the additional cost. Example: Application of the additional payroll costs on the schedule Additional payroll costs will affect both the costs on the schedule and the revenue report. Please keep in mind that as this addition only takes place for scheduled costs (as a simulation), these rules will not change the payroll costs. This can be useful when checking the Revenue bar on the Schedule page. Here is the Revenue bar, with both revenue and payroll costs displayed, before adding a simple 10% additional payroll cost: And here is the same bar, with the 10% rule attached: As you can see, by adding the additional cost, a schedule that looks under budget would come in over budget when the scheduled costs more accurately represent the actual cost of employment.

Written by  Saad Saeed   Updated over a week ago Table of contents 🎯  For experienced admins.  Assign a salary to your employees  first. Enable payroll costs in the schedule You can view the payroll hours and costs of your salaried and waged employees in the schedule to help you to plan your shifts effectively.    💡  You can activate the settings for payroll costs to appear on the schedule by going to  Schedule  >  View settings  > and activating  Payroll hours & costs. If you pay employees a fixed salary instead of wages, you have various options for calculating the salary costs in the schedule. In this article, you will learn about those calculation methods and can decide which method to use.   To assign a fixed salary to an employee, see the article  How to set an employee's fixed salary . Select an employee >  Edit  >  Employment  >  Salary  >  Edit salary . In the top section of the edit window - Payroll information - you should see the data entered for your employee's salary:   If salary data has been added, go to the next section  Payroll costs in Schedule. 💡 Remember that the cost allocation and payroll are different. Salary will be reflected in the payroll as a set amount regardless of how you allocate the cost in the schedule. Calculate payroll costs based on Salary amount In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Salary amount .   You can see a direct calculation of this in the lower section, Estimated costs per hour. Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary amount is divided by the number of shift hours in the schedule for the current salary period. When entered in the rota, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works that day. Example: An employee is paid a fixed salary of £2000. The estimated cost per hour - £26.67 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of shift hours in the schedule - in this case, 75. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift in the schedule is given as £160.02 (6*£26.67). 💡  The  Payroll start day  is the day of the month from which each salary calculation will begin. This value can't be set as a higher number because the month of February has 28 days (with the exception of leap years). Calculate payroll costs based on Scheduled hours In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Shifts  > and then select  Scheduled hours .   You can see a direct calculation in the lower section  Estimated hourly cost . Confirm your selection by clicking  Save .   With this option, the estimated hourly cost is calculated as follows: The fixed salary is divided by the expected working hours in the Schedule. When entered in the schedule, this value is multiplied by the number of hours the employee works on that day. The total cost may therefore differ from the fixed salary, depending on how many hours are assigned to the employee. The actual salary cost will not change for Payroll even if the cost on the Schedule is higher/lower.   Example: An employee receives a fixed salary sum of £2.000 and is supposed to work 60 hours per month according to their contract. The estimated cost per hour - £33.33 - is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the expected hours worked. If the employee is assigned a shift of 6 hours on one day, the salary cost for this shift is indicated in the schedule as 200.00£ (6 * £33.33). Calculate payroll costs based on Business days In the  Payroll costs in Schedule , under  Show cost based on , select  Bussiness days . For  Business days , select the days of the week to be included in the calculation.  For  Show in Schedule for , select the department in which to display the salary costs. In the lower area,  Estimated daily cost , you can see a direct calculation. Optional: You can change the day of the month from which the salary is calculated at  Show cost calculation each month, starting from . Confirm your selection by pressing  Save . The estimated daily cost is calculated by dividing the fixed salary amount by the number of opening days in the  Pay period  (by default: Monthly). The estimated daily cost may vary from month to month, depending on the business days in the period.   Don’t show (default) By default, the option  Don't show  is set. This means that the fixed salary is not taken into account when calculating the total payroll costs on the schedule. However, it remains added for the Payroll export data.   Need more help?
